<h2>PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</h2>


<p>While the poetical versions of Juvenal deservedly hold a very
high place in the literature of this country, it is a curious fact that
there exists no single prose translation which can stand the test of even
ordinary criticism. Whether it be that the temptation to a metrical
version of a poetical writer is too great with some, or whether the
labor of faithfully representing the genius of confessedly the most
difficult writer in the Latin language has deterred others, the fact
is undeniable, that there is no prose version from which the unclassical
reader can form any adequate idea of the writings of the
greatest of Satirists.</p>

<p>Madan, though faithful, is utterly unintelligible to any one who
has not the Latin before him. Sheridan is far too free, in every
sense of the word, to be either a fair expositor of his original, or to
suit the taste of the present day; and without any disparagement of
the labors of Sterling, Nuttall, Smart, or Wallace, it was found impossible
to adopt any one of them even as the <em>basis</em> of a version
which should be worthy of a place in the present series.</p>

<p>The accompanying translation, therefore, is entirely original; and
the translator is not aware of having copied a single line from any
previous version. How far he has succeeded in giving a faithful
transcript of the author, and in, at the same time, infusing some spark
of the fire and spirit of the original, must be for others to determine;
all that he dares venture to assert is, that he has brought to the task
an enthusiastic admiration of his author, and a careful study of many
years. The same remarks apply to the translation of Persius.</p>

<p>The notes are to a considerable extent original, and the English,
perhaps even the classical, reader may not be displeased at the occasional
introduction of passages from metrical versions in which
the sense appeared to be the most forcibly given.</p>

<p>A Chronological Table has been added, which the labors of Mr.
Clinton have enabled the Translator to present in a far more correct
form than heretofore.</p>

<p>The poetical version by Gifford has been annexed, as having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iva" id="Page_iva">[Pg iv]</a></span>
greatest hold on the public favor, and as being perhaps the best, because
the most equal; though, unquestionably, in all the Satires
which Dryden translated, he has immeasurably surpassed Gifford
in fire and spirit, as Hodgson has in elegance and poetic genius,
and Badham in taste, scholarship, and terse and vigorous rendering.
But Gifford is always equal, and generally faithful.</p>

<p>The remains of Sulpicia and Lucilius appear now for the first
time in English. Of the value of the latter, and of the propriety
of appending his Fragments to a translation of the great Roman
Satirists, no scholar-like reader of Juvenal and Horace can entertain
a doubt. The recent labors of foreign scholars have presented us
with the text in a purer form than almost any collection of Fragments
of the older Latin writers. In the Arguments prefixed to
the several Books, and in the notes, will be found the essence of the
criticisms of Jan. Dousa, Van Heusde, Corpet, Schoenbeck, Schmidt,
Petermann, and especially of Gerlach, whose readings have in general
been preferred.</p>

<h2>THE LIFE OF JUVENAL,<br />

BY WILLIAM GIFFORD, ESQ.</h2>


<p>Decimus Junius Juvenalis,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the author of the following
Satires, was born at Aquinum, an inconsiderable town of the
Volsci, about the year of Christ 38.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He was either the son,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>or the foster-son, of a wealthy freedman, who gave him a liberal
education. From the period of his birth, till he had attained
the age of forty, nothing more is known of him than that
he continued to perfect himself in the study of eloquence, by
declaiming, according to the practice of those days; yet more
for his own amusement, than from any intention to prepare
himself either for the schools or the courts of law. About
this time he seems to have discovered his true bent, and betaken
himself to poetry. Domitian was now at the head of
the government, and showed symptoms of reviving that system
of favoritism which had nearly ruined the empire under
Claudius, by his unbounded partiality for a young pantomime
dancer of the name of Paris. Against this minion, Juvenal
seems to have directed the first shafts of that satire which was
destined to make the most powerful vices tremble, and shake
the masters of the world on their thrones. He composed a
few lines<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on the influence of Paris, with considerable success,
which encouraged him to cultivate this kind of poetry: he had
the prudence, however, not to trust himself to an auditory, in
a reign which swarmed with informers; and his compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>were, therefore, secretly handed about among his friends.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
By degrees he grew bolder; and, having made many large
additions to his first sketch, or perhaps re-cast it, produced
what is now called his Seventh Satire, which he recited to a
numerous assemblage. The consequences were such as he
had probably anticipated: Paris, informed of the part which
he bore in it, was seriously offended, and complained to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>emperor, who, as the old account has it,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> sent the author, by
an easy kind of punishment, into Egypt with a military command.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
To remove such a man from his court must undoubtedly
have been desirable to Domitian; and, as he was spoken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>of with kindness in the same Satire, which is entirely free
from political allusions, the "facetiousness" of the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
(though Domitian's was not a facetious reign) renders the fact
not altogether improbable. Yet, when we consider that these
reflections on Paris could scarcely have been published before
<span class="smcap">LXXXIV.</span>, and that the favorite was disgraced and put to
death almost immediately after, we shall be inclined to doubt
whether his banishment actually took place; or, if it did,
whether it was of any long duration. That Juvenal was in
Egypt is certain; but he might have gone there from motives
of personal safety, or, as Salmasius has it, of curiosity. However
this may be, it does not appear that he was ever long
absent from Rome, where a thousand internal marks clearly
show that all his Satires were written. But whatever punishment
might have followed the complaint of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> it had no
other effect on our author, than that of increasing his hatred
of tyranny, and turning his indignation upon the emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>himself, whose hypocrisy, cruelty, and licentiousness, became,
from that period, the object of his keenest reprobation. He
profited, indeed, so far by his danger or his punishment, as to
recite no more in public; but he continued to write during
the remainder of Domitian's reign, in which he finished, as I
conceive, his second, third,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> fifth, sixth,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and perhaps thirteenth<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Satires; the eighth<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I have always looked upon as his
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">XCV.</span>, when Juvenal was in his 54th year, Domitian banished
the philosophers from Rome, and soon after from Italy,
with many circumstances of cruelty; an action, for which,
I am sorry to observe, he is covertly praised by Quintilian.
Though Juvenal, strictly speaking, did not come under the
description of a philosopher, yet, like the hare in the fable, he
might not unreasonably entertain some apprehensions for his
safety, and, with many other persons eminent for learning and
virtue, judge it prudent to withdraw from the city. To this
period I have always inclined to fix his journey to Egypt.
Two years afterward the world was happily relieved from
the tyranny of Domitian; and Nerva, who succeeded him, recalled
the exiles. From this time there remains little doubt
of Juvenal's being at Rome, where he continued his studies in
tranquillity.</p>

<p>His first Satire after the death of Domitian, seems to have
been what is now called the fourth. About this time, too, he
probably thought of revising and publishing those which he
had already written; and composed or completed that introductory
piece,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which now stands at the head of his works.
As the order is every where broken in upon, it is utterly impossible
to arrange them chronologically; but I am inclined
to think that the eleventh Satire closed his poetical career.
All else is conjecture; but in this he speaks of himself as an
old man,</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula solem;"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>and indeed he had now passed his grand climacteric.</p>

<p>This is all that can be collected of the life of Juvenal; and
how much of this is built upon uncertainties! I hope, however,
that it bears the stamp of probability; which is all I
contend for; and which, indeed, if I do not deceive myself, is
somewhat more than can be affirmed of what has been hitherto
delivered on the subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>
<p>Little is known of Juvenal's circumstances; but, happily,
that little is authentic, as it comes from himself. He had a
competence. The dignity of poetry is never disgraced in him,
as it is in some of his contemporaries, by fretful complaints
of poverty, or clamorous whinings for meat and clothes: the
little patrimony which his fosterfather left him, he never
diminished, and probably never increased. It seems to have
equaled all his wants, and, as far as appears, all his wishes.
Once only he regrets the narrowness of his fortune; but the
occasion does him honor; it is solely because he can not afford
a more costly sacrifice to express his pious gratitude for the
preservation of his friend: yet "two lambs and a youthful
steer" bespeak the affluence of a philosopher; which is not
belied by the entertainment provided for his friend Persicus,
in that beautiful Satire which is here called the last of his
works. Farther it is useless to seek: from pride or modesty,
he has left no other notices of himself; or they have perished.
Horace and Persius, his immediate predecessors, are never
weary of speaking of themselves. The life of the former
might be written, from his own materials, with all the minuteness
of a contemporary history: and the latter, who
attained to little more than a third of Juvenal's age, has left
nothing to be desired on the only topics which could interest
posterity&mdash;his parent, his preceptor, and his course of studies.</p>

mediam ætatem declamavit, animi magis causa, quam quod scholæ aut
foro se præpararet." The learned reader knows that this is taken from
the brief account of Juvenal, commonly attributed to Suetonius; but
which is probably posterior to his time; as it bears very few marks of
being written by a contemporary author: it is, however, the earliest extant.
The old critics, struck with its deficiencies, have attempted to
render it more complete by variations, which take from its authenticity,
without adding to its probability.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I have adopted Dodwell's chronology. "Sic autem (he says) se rem
illam totam habuisse censeo. Exul erat Juv. cum Satiram scriberet
xv. Hoc confirmat etiam in v. 27, scholiastes. 'De se Juv. dicit, quia
in Ægypto militem tenuit, et ea promittit se relaturum quæ ipse vidit.'"
Had not Dodwell been predisposed to believe this, he would have seen
that the scholium "confirmed" nothing: for Juvenal makes no such
promise. "Proinde rixæ illi ipse adfuit quam describit." So error is
built up! How does it appear that Juvenal was present at the quarrel
which he describes? He was in Egypt, we know; he had passed through
the Ombite nome, and he speaks of the face of the country as falling
under his own inspection: but this is all; and he might have heard of
the quarrel at Rome, or elsewhere. "Tempus autem ipse designavit
rixæ illius cum et 'nuper'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> illam contigisse dicit, et quidem 'Consule
Junio.' Jun. duplicem habent fasti, alium Domit. in x. Consulatu collegam
App. Junium Sabinum <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> lxxxiv.; alium Hadriani in suo itidem
consulatu <span class="smcap">III.</span> collegam Q. Junium Rusticum. Quo minus prior
intelligi possit, obstant illa omnia quæ in his ipsis Satiris occurrunt Domitiani
temporibus recentiora." Yet, such is the capricious nature of
criticism! Dodwell's chief argument to prove the late period at which
Juvenal was banished, is a passage confessedly written under Domitian,
and foisted into a satire published, as he himself maintains, many years
after that emperor's death! "Posteriorem ergo intellexerit oportet.
Hoc ergo anno (<span class="smcap">CXIX.</span>) erat in exilio. Sed vero Roma illum ejicere non
potuit Trajanus, qui ab anno usque <span class="smcap">CXII.</span> Romæ ipse non adfuit; nec
etiam ante <span class="smcap">CXVIII.</span> quo Romam venit imperator Hadrianus. Sic ante
anni <span class="smcap">CXVIII.</span> finem, aut <span class="smcap">CXIX.</span> initium, mitti vix potuit in exilium Juvenalis:
erat autem cum relegaretur, octogenarius. Proinde natus fuerit
vel anni <span class="smcap">XXXVIII.</span> fine, vel <span class="smcap">XXXIX.</span> initio." Annal. 157-159.
</p>
<p>
I have made this copious extract from Dodwell, because it contains a
summary of the chief arguments which induced Pithæus, Henninius, Lipsius,
Salmasius, etc., to attribute the banishment of the author to Hadrian.
To me they appear any thing but conclusive; for, to omit other objections
for the present, why may not the Junius of the fifteenth Satire
be the one who was Consul with Domitian in 84, when Juvenal, by Dodwell's
own calculation, was in his 47th instead of his 80th year.</p></div>

this and the following clause, to have referred to Juvenal's words; it is,
therefore probable that we should read Calvi Neronis, <em>i. e.</em> Domitian;
otherwise the phrase must be given up as an absurd interpolation), "ejus

ausus est." Suet. On this Dodwell observes: "Tam longe aberant illa
a Paridis ira concitanda, si vel superstite Paride fuissent scripta, eum
irritare non possent, cum nondum emanassent in publicum," 161. He
then adds that "Martial knew nothing of his poetical studies,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who
boasted that he was as familiar with Juvenal as Pylades with Orestes!"
It appears, indeed, that they were acquainted; but I suspect, notwithstanding
the vehemence of Martial's assertions, that there was no great
cordiality between minds so very dissimilar. Some one, it seems, had
accused the epigrammatist to the satirist, not improbably, of making too
free with his thoughts and expressions. He was seriously offended;
and Martial, instead of justifying himself (whatever the charge might
be), imprecates shame on his accuser in a strain of idle rant not much
above the level of a schoolboy. Lib. vii. 24.
</p>
<p>
But if he had been acquainted with his friend's poetry, he would certainly
have spoken of it. Not quite so certainly. These learned critics
seem to think that Juvenal, like the poets he ridicules, wrote nothing but
trite fooleries on the Argonauts and the Lapithæ. Were the Satires of
Juvenal to be mentioned with approbation? and, if they were, was Martial
the person to do it? Martial, the most devoted sycophant of the age,
who was always begging, and sometimes receiving, favors from the man
whose castigation was, in general, the express object of them. Is it not
more consonant to his character to suppose that he would conceal his
knowledge of them with the most scrupulous care?
</p>
<p>
But when Domitian was dead, and Martial removed from Rome, when,
in short, there was no danger of speaking out, he still appears, continue
they, to be ignorant of his friend's poetic talents. I am almost ashamed
to repeat what the critics so constantly forget&mdash;that Juvenal was not only
satirist, but a republican, who looked upon Trajan as a usurper, no
less than Domitian. And how was it "safe to speak out," when they
all assert that he was driven into banishment by a milder prince than
Trajan, for a passage "suspected of being a figurative allusion to the
times?" What inconsistencies are these!</p></div>

intra brevissimum tempus angore et tædio periit." Suet. Passing by the
interpolations of the old grammarians, I shall, as before, have recourse
to Dodwell. "Recitavit, ni fallor, omnia, emisitque in publicum <span class="smcap">CXVIII.</span>
(Juvenal was now fourscore!) postquam Romam venissit Hadrianus
quem ille principem à benevolo ejus in hæc studia animo, in hac ipsa
satira in qua occurrunt verba illa de Paride commendat." 161. Salmasius
supposed that the last of his Satires only were published under Hadrian;
Dodwell goes farther, and maintains that the whole, with the exception
of the 15th and 16th<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ("si tamen vere et illa Juvenalis fuerit"), were
then first produced! "Illa in Paridem dicteria histrionem, in suum (cujus
nomen non prodidit auctor) histrionem dicta interpretabatur Hadrianus.
Inde exilii causa. Scripsit ergo in exilio Sat. <span class="smcap">XV.</span> Sed cum 'nuper
Consulem Junium' fuisse dicat, ante annum ad minimum <span class="smcap">CXX.</span> scribere
illam non potuit Juv. Nec vero postea scripsisse, exinde colligimus, quod
'intra brevissimum tempus' perierit." 164. Such is the manner in which
Dodwell accommodates Suetonius to his own ideas: which seem, also,
to have been those of a much higher name, Salmasius; and, while I am
now writing, to be sanctioned by the adoption of the learned Ruperti.
I never affected singularity; yet I find myself constrained to differ from
them all: but I will state my reasons. In his 7th Satire, after speaking
of Quintilian, Juvenal adds,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si fortuna volet, fies de rhetore consul:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si volet hæc eadem fies de consule rhetor."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Which, taking it for a proverbial expression, I have loosely rendered,
Fortune can make kings of pedants and pedants of kings. Dodwell,
however, understands it literally. "Hæc sane cum Quintiliani causa dicat,
vix est quin Q. talem ostendant è rhetore nimirum 'nobilem, senatorium,
consularem,' et quidem illis divitiis instructum, quæ essent etiam
ad censum senatorium necessariæ." 152. Now, as Pliny, who probably
died before Trajan, observes that Quintilian was a man of moderate fortune,
it follows that he must have acquired the wealth and honors of
which Juvenal speaks at a later period. Dodwell fixes this to the time
when Hadrian entered Rome, <span class="smcap">CXVIII.</span>, which he states to be also that of
the author's banishment. It must be confessed that Juvenal lost no time
in exerting himself: he had remained silent fourscore years; he now
bursts forth at once, as Dodwell expresses it, recites all his Satires without
intermission ("unis continuisque recitationibus"), celebrates Quintilian,
attacks the emperor, and is immediately dispatched to Egypt! 162.
Here is a great deal of business crowded into the compass of a few weeks,
or perhaps days; but let us examine it a little more closely. Rigaltius,
with several of the commentators, sees in the lines above quoted a sneer
at Quintilian, and he accounts for the rhetor's silence respecting our author,
by the resentment which he supposes him to have felt at it. As
this militates strongly against Dodwell's ideas, he will not allow that any
thing severe was intended by the passage in question; and adds that
Quintilian could not mention Juvenal as a satirist, because he had not
then written any satires. 160. I believe that both are wrong. In speaking
of the satirists, Quintilian says that Persius had justly acquired no
inconsiderable degree of reputation by the little he had written. Lib. x.,
c. 1. He then adds, "sunt clari hodieque, et qui olim nominabuntur."
There are yet some excellent ones, some who will be better known hereafter.
It always appeared to me, that this last phrase alluded to our
author, with whose extraordinary merits Quintilian was probably acquainted,
but whom he did not choose, or, perhaps, did not dare to mention
in a work composed under a prince whose crimes this unnamed
satirist persecuted with a severity as unmitigated as it was just. Quintilian
had no political courage. Either from a sense of kindness or fear,
he flatters Domitian almost as grossly as Martial does: but his life was
a life of innocence and integrity; I will therefore say no more on this subject;
but leave it to the reader to consider whether such a man was likely
to startle the "god of his idolatry" by celebrating the Satires of Juvenal.
</p>
<p>
Nor do I agree with the commentators whom Dodwell has followed, in
the literal interpretation of those famous lines. "Unde igitur tot," etc.
Sat. vii., v. 188-194. Quintilian was rich, when the rest of his profession
were in the utmost want. Here then was an instance of good fortune.
He was lucky; and with luck a man may be any thing; handsome, and
witty, and wise, and noble, and high-born, and a member of the senate.
Who does not see in this a satirical exaggeration? Wisdom, beauty,
and high birth luck can not give: why then should the remainder of this
passage be so strictly interpreted, and referred to the actual history of
Quintilian? The lines, "Si fortuna volet," etc., are still more lax: a
reflection thrown out at random, and expressing the greatest possible
extremes of fortune. Yet on these authorities principally (for the passage
of Ausonius,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> written more than two centuries later, is of no great
weight) has Quintilian been advanced to consular honors; while Dodwell,
who, as we have seen, has taken immense pains to prove that they could
only be conferred on him by Hadrian, has hence deduced his strongest arguments
for the late date of our author's Satires; which he thus brings
down to the period of mental imbecility! Hence, too, he accounts for
the different ideas of Quintilian's wealth in Juvenal and Pliny. When
the latter wrote, he thinks Quintilian had not acquired much property, he
was "modicus facultatibus:" when the former, "he had been enriched
by the imperial bounty, and was capable of senatorial honors." Yet
Pliny might not think his old master rich enough to give a fortune with
his daughter adequate to the expectations of a man of considerable rank
(lib. vi., 32), though Juvenal, writing at the same instant, might term
him wealthy, in comparison of the rhetoricians who were starving around
him; and count him a peculiar favorite of fortune. Let us bear in mind,
too, that Juvenal is a satirist, and a poet: in the latter capacity, the minute
accuracy of an annalist can not be expected at his hands; and in
the former&mdash;as his object was to show the general discouragement of literature,
he could not, consistently with his plan, attribute the solitary
good fortune of Quintilian to any thing but luck.
</p>
<p>
But why was Quintilian made consul? Because, replies Dodwell
(164), when Hadrian first entered Rome he was desirous of gaining the
affections of the people; which could be done no way so effectually as by
conciliating the esteem of the literati; and he therefore conferred this
extraordinary mark of favor on the rhetorician. How did it escape this
learned man, that he was likely to do himself more injury in their opinion
by the banishment of Juvenal at that same instant? an old man of fourscore,
who, by his own testimony, had spoken of him with kindness, in a
poem which did more honor to his reign than any thing produced in it!
and whose only crime was an allusion to the influence of a favorite player!
Indeed, the informers of Hadrian's reign must have had more sagacious
noses than those of Domitian's, to smell out his fault. What Statius, in
his time, was celebrated for the recitation of a Thebaid, or what Paris,
for the purchase of an untouched Agave? And where, might we ask
Dodwell, was the "jest" of sending a man on the verge of the grave, in
a military capacity, into Egypt? Could the most supple of Hadrian's
courtiers look on it as any thing but a wanton exercise of cruelty? At
eighty, the business of satirizing, either in prose or verse, is nearly over:
what had the emperor then to fear? And to sum up all in a word, can
any rational being seriously persuade himself that the Satires of Juvenal
were produced, for the first time, by a man turned of fourscore?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> But why should he complain at all? Was he ashamed of being
known to possess an influence at the imperial court? Those were not
very modest times, nor is modesty, in general, the crying vice of the
"quality." He was more likely to have gloried in it. If Bareas, or
Camerinus, or any of the old nobility, had complained of the author, I
should have thought it more reasonable: but Domitian cared nearly as
little for them as Paris himself did.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I hold, in opposition to the commentators, that Juvenal was known
in Domitian's time, not only as a poet, but as a keen and vigorous satirist.
He himself, though he did not choose to commit his safety to a
promiscuous audience, appears to make no great secret of his peculiar
talents. In this Satire, certainly prior to many of the others, he tells us
that he accompanied Umbritius, then on his way to Cumæ, out of the
gates of Rome. Umbritius predicted, as Tacitus says, the death of
Galba, at which time he was looked upon as the most skillful aruspex of
the age. He could not then be a young man; yet, at quitting the capital,
he still talks of himself as in the first stage of old age, "nova canities,
et prima et recta senectus." His voluntary exile, therefore, could not
possibly have taken place long after the commencement of Domitian's
reign; when he speaks of Juvenal as already celebrated for his Satires,
and modestly doubts whether the assistance of so able a coadjutor as
himself would be accepted.
</p>
<p>
This, at least, serves to prove in what light the author wished to be
considered: for the rest, there can, I think, exclusively of what I have
urged, be little doubt that this Satire was produced under Domitian. It
is known, from other authorities, that he revived the law of Otho in all
its severity, that he introduced a number of low and vicious characters,
"pinnirapi cultos juvenes, juvenesque lanistæ," into the Equestrian Order,
that he was immoderately attached to building, etc., circumstances
much dwelt on in this Satire, and applicable to him alone.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The following line, "Dacicus et scripto radiat Germanicus auro,"
seems to militate against the early date of this Satire. Catanæus and
Arntzenius say that Juvenal could not mean Domitian here, because
"he did not think well enough of him to do him such honor; whereas
he was fond of commending Trajan." I see no marks of this fondness;
nor were the titles, if meant of Domitian, intended to do him honor, but
to reprove his vanity.
</p>
<p>
Whether medals were ever struck with the inscription of Dacicus and
Germanicus in honor of Domitian, I am not qualified to determine.
Certain it is, however, that he assumed both these titles; the latter, indeed,
in common with his predecessors from the time of Germ. Cæsar;
and the former, in consequence of his pretended success in the Dacian
war, for which he is bitterly sneered at by Pliny, as well as Dio. It is
given to him, among others, by Martial, who dedicates his eighth book,
"Imper. Domit. Cæs. Augusto Germanico <em>Dacico</em>." Dodwell appropriates
(as I do) the line to Domitian&mdash;a little inconsistently, it must be
confessed; but that is his concern. If, however, it be adjudged to Trajan,
I should not for that bring down the date of the Satire to a later
period. Juvenal revised and enlarged all his works, when he gave them
to the public: this under consideration, in particular, has all the marks
of having received considerable additions; and one of them might be
the line in question.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This satire has contributed as much perhaps as the seventh to persuade
Lipsius, Salmasius, and others, that Juvenal wrote his best pieces
when he was turned of fourscore.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;Stupet hæc, qui jam post terga reliquit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sexaginta annos, Fonteio Consule natus!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
There were four consuls of this name. The first is out of the question;
the second was consul <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 13, the third in 59, and the fourth in 68. If
we take the second, and add any intermediate number of years between
sixty and seventy, for Calvinus had passed his sixtieth year, it will just
bring us down to the early part of Domitian's reign, which I suppose to
be the true date of this Satire; for I can not believe, as I have already
observed, that this, or indeed any part of Juvenal's works, was produced
when he was trembling on the verge of ninety, as must be the case if either
of the latter periods be adopted. But he observes, "Hæc quota
pars scelerum quæ custos Gallicus urbis," etc. Now Rutilius Gallicus
was præfect of Rome from the end of 85 to 88 (Domitian succeeded his
brother in 81), in which year he died. There seems to be no necessity
for mentioning a magistrate as sitting, who was not then in existence;
nor can any reason be assigned, if the Satire was written under Hadrian,
for the author's recurring to the times of Domitian for a name, when
that of the "custos urbis" of the day would have better answered his
purpose. It is probable that Gallicus succeeded Pegasus, who was præfect
when the ridiculous farce of the turbot took place (Sat. iv.); this
would fix it to 85, the year before Fuscus, who was present at it, was
sent into Dacia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This Satire is referred by the critics to the reign of Trajan, because
Marius, whose trial took place under that prince, is mentioned in it. I
have attributed it to an earlier period; principally moved by the consideration
that it presents a faithful copy of the state of Rome and the conquered
provinces under Nero, and which could scarcely have been given
in such vivid colors after the original had ceased to affect the mind.
What Rome was under Domitian, may be seen in the second Satire, and
the difference, which has not been sufficiently attended to, is striking in
the extreme. I would observe too, that Juvenal speaks here of the
<em>crimes</em> of Marius&mdash;they might be, and probably were, committed long
before his condemnation; but under Domitian it was scarcely safe to attempt
bringing such gigantic peculators to justice. Add to this, that the
other culprits mentioned in it are all of them prior to that prince; nay,
one of them, Capito, was tried so early as the beginning of Nero's reign.
The insertion of Marius, however (which might be an after-thought),
forms a main argument with Dodwell for the very late date of this Satire;
he observes that it had escaped Lipsius and Salmasius; and boasts
of it as "longe certissimum," etc. 156.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> I have often wondered at the stress which Dodwell and others lay
on the concluding lines of this Satire: "Experiar quid concedatur,"
etc. They fancy that the engagement was seriously made, and religiously
observed. Nothing was ever farther from the mind of Juvenal. It
is merely a poetical, or, if you will, a satirical, flourish; since there is not
a single Satire, I am well persuaded, in which the names of many who
were alive at the time are not introduced. Had Dodwell forgotten
Quintilian? or, that he had allowed one of his Satires, at least, to be
prior to this?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> This "nuper" is a very convenient word. Here, we see, it signifies lately; but
when it is necessary to bring the works of our author down to a late period, it means,
as Britannicus explains it, "de longo tempore," long ago.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> But how to this ascertained? Very easily; he calls him "fecundus Juvenalis."
Here the question is finally left; for none of the commentators suppose it possible
that the epithet can be applied to any but a rhetorician. Yet it is applied by the
same writer to a poet of no ordinary kind;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Accipe, <em>facundi</em> Culicem, studiose. Maronis<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p>
Let it be remembered, too, that Martial, as is evident from the frequent allusions to
Domitian's expedition against the Catti, wrote this epigram (lib. vii., 91) in the commencement
of that prince's reign, when it is acknowledged that Juvenal had produced
but one or two of his Satires.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The former of these, Dodwell says, was written in exile, after the author was
turned of eighty. Salmasius, more rationally, conceives it to have been produced at
Rome. Giving full credit, however, to the story of his late banishment, he is driven
into a very awkward supposition. "An non alio tempore, atque alia de causa Ægyptum
lustrare juvenis potuit Juvenalis? animi nempe gratia, και της ἱστοριας χαριν, ut
urbes regionis illius, populorumque mores cognosceret?" Would it not be more simple
to attribute his exile at once to Domitian?
</p>
<p>
With respect to the 16th Satire, Dodwell, we see, hesitates to attribute it to Juvenal;
and, indeed, the old Scholiast says, that, in his time, many thought it to be the work
of a different hand. So it always appeared to me. It is unworthy of the author's best
days, and seems but little suited to his worst. He was at least eighty-one, they say,
when he wrote it, yet it begins&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;Nam si&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me pavidum excipiet tyronem porta secundo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidere," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Surely, at this age, the writer resembled Priam, the <em>tremulus miles</em>, more than the
timid tyro! Nor do I believe that Juvenal would have been much inclined to amuse
himself with the fancied advantages of a profession to which he was so unworthily
driven. But the Satire must have been as ill-timed for the army as for himself, since
it was probably, at this period, in a better state of subjection than it had been for many
reigns. I suppose it to be written in professed imitation of our author's manner,
about the age of Commodus. It has considerable merit, though the first and last paragraphs
are feeble and tautological; and the execution of the whole is much inferior to
the design.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> "Q. consularia per Clementem ornamenta sortitus, honestamenta potius videtur
quam insignia potestatis habuisse. In gratiar. act." Quintilian, then, was not actually
consul: but this is no great matter&mdash;it is of more consequence to ascertain the Clemens
by whom he was so honored. In the preface to his fourth book, he says, "Cum vero
mihi Dom. Augustus sororis suæ nepotum delegavit curam," etc. Vespasian had a
daughter, Domitilla, who married, and died long before her father: she left a daughter,
who was given to Flavius Clemens, by whom she had two sons. These were the grandchildren
of Domitian's sister, of whom Quintilian speaks; and to their father, Clemens,
according to Ausonius, he was indebted for the show, though not the reality, of power.
There is nothing incongruous in all this; yet so possessed are Dodwell and his numerous
followers (among whom I am sorry to rank Dusaulx) of the late period at which it
happened, that they will needs have Hadrian to be meant by Domitianus Augustus,
though the detestable flattery which follows the words I have quoted most indisputably
proves it to be Domitian; and though Dodwell himself is forced to confess that he
can find no Clemens under Hadrian to whom the passage applies: "Quis autem fuerit
Clemens ille qui Q. ornamenta illa sub Hadriano impetraverit, me sane fateor ignorare!"
165. Another circumstance which has escaped all the commentators, and which
is of considerable importance in determining the question, remains to be noticed. At
the very period of which Dodwell treats, the boundaries of the empire were politically
contracted, while Juvenal, whenever he has occasion to speak on the subject, invariably
dwells on extending or securing them.</p>

<h2>AN<br />

ESSAY ON THE ROMAN SATIRISTS,<br />

BY WILLIAM GIFFORD, ESQ.</h2>


<p>It will now be expected from me, perhaps, to say something
on the nature and design of Satire; but in truth this
has so frequently been done, that it seems, at present, to have
as little of novelty as of utility to recommend it.</p>

<p>Dryden, who had diligently studied the French critics, drew
up from their remarks, assisted by a cursory perusal of what
Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, and Scaliger had written on
the subject, an account of the rise and progress of dramatic
and satiric poetry among the Romans; which he prefixed to
his translation of Juvenal. What Dryden knew, he told in a
manner that renders every attempt to recount it after him
equally hopeless and vain; but his acquaintance with works
of literature was not very extensive, while his reliance on his
own powers sometimes betrayed him into inaccuracies, to
which the influence of his name gives a dangerous importance.</p>

<p>"The comparison of Horace with Juvenal and Persius,"
which makes a principal part of his Essay, is not formed with
much niceness of discrimination, or accuracy of judgment.
To speak my mind, I do not think that he clearly perceived
or fully understood the characters of the first two: of Persius
indeed he had an intimate knowledge; for, though he certainly
deemed too humbly of his poetry, he yet speaks of his beauties
and defects in a manner which evinces a more than common
acquaintance with both.</p>

<p>What Dryden left imperfect has been filled up in a great
measure by Dusaulx, in the preliminary discourse to his translation
of Juvenal, and by Ruperti, in his critical Essay "De
diversa Satirarum Lucil. Horat. Pers. et Juvenalis indole."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
With the assistance of the former of these I shall endeavor to
give a more extended view of the characteristic excellencies
and defects of the rival Satirists than has yet appeared in our
language; little solicitous for the praise of originality, if I
may be allowed to aspire to that of candor and truth. Previously
to this, however, it will be necessary to say something
on the supposed origin of Satire: and, as this is a very beaten
subject, I shall discuss it as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>It is probable that the first metrical compositions of the
Romans, like those of every other people, were pious effusions
for favors received or expected from the gods: of these, the
earliest, according to Varro, were the hymns to Mars, which,
though used by the Salii in the Augustan age, were no longer
intelligible. To these succeeded the Fescennine verses, which
were sung, or rather recited, after the vintage and harvest,
and appear to have been little more than rude praises of the
tutelar divinities of the country, intermixed with clownish
jeers and sarcasms, extemporally poured out by the rustics in
some kind of measure, and indifferently directed at the audience,
or at one another. These, by degrees, assumed the form
of a dialogue; of which, as nature is every where the same,
and the progress of refinement but little varied, some resemblance
may perhaps be found in the grosser eclogues of Theocritus.</p>

<p>Thus improved (if the word may be allowed of such barbarous
amusements), they formed, for near three centuries,
the delight of that nation: popular favor, however, had a
dangerous effect on the performers, whose licentiousness degenerated
at length into such wild invective, that it was found
necessary to restrain it by a positive law: "Si qui populo
occentassit, carmenve condisit, quod infamiam faxit flagitiumve
alteri, fuste ferito." From this time we hear no farther
complaints of the Fescennine verses, which continued to charm
the Romans; until, about a century afterward, and during
the ravages of a dreadful pestilence, the senate, as the historians
say, in order to propitiate the gods, called a troop of
players from Tuscany, to assist at the celebration of their
ancient festivals. This was a wise and a salutary measure:
the plague had spread dejection through the city, which was
thus rendered more obnoxious to its fury; and it therefore became
necessary, by novel and extraordinary amusements, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
divert the attention of the people from the melancholy objects
around them.</p>

<p>As the Romans were unacquainted with the language of
Tuscany, the players, Livy tells us, omitted the modulation
and the words, and confined themselves solely to gestures,
which were accompanied by the flute. This imperfect exhibition,
however, was so superior to their own, that the Romans
eagerly strove to attain the art; and, as soon as they could
imitate what they admired, graced their rustic measures with
music and dancing. By degrees they dropped the Fescennine
verses for something of a more regular kind, which now took
the name of <span class="smcap">Satire</span>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>These Satires (for as yet they had but little claim to the
title of dramas) continued, without much alteration, to the year
514, when Livius Andronicus, a Greek by birth, and a freedman
of L. Salinator, who was undoubtedly acquainted with
the old comedy of his country, produced a regular play. That
it pleased can not be doubted, for it surpassed the Satires, even
in their improved state; and, indeed, banished them for some
time from the scene. They had, however, taken too strong a
hold of the affections of the people to be easily forgotten, and
it was therefore found necessary to reproduce and join them
to the plays of Andronicus (the superiority of which could not
be contested), under the name of Exodia or After-pieces.
These partook, in a certain degree, of the general amelioration
of the stage; something like a story was now introduced into
them, which, though frequently indecent and always extravagant,
created a greater degree of interest than the reciprocation
of gross humor and scurrility in unconnected dialogues.</p>

<p>Whether any of the old people still regretted this sophistication
of their early amusements, it is not easy to say; but
Ennius, who came to Rome about twenty years after this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
period, and who was more than half a Grecian, conceived that
he should perform an acceptable service by reviving the ancient
Satires.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He did not pretend to restore them to the stage,
for which indeed the new pieces were infinitely better calculated,
but endeavored to adapt them to the closet, by refining
their grossness and softening their asperity. Success justified
the attempt. Satire, thus freed from action, and formed into
a poem, became a favorite pursuit, and was cultivated by
several writers of eminence. In imitation of his model, Ennius
confined himself to no particular species of verse, nor indeed
of language, for he mingled Greek expressions with his Latin
at pleasure. It is solely with a reference to this new attempt
that Horace and Quintilian are to be understood, when they
claim for the Romans the invention<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of this kind of poetry;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>and certainly they had opportunities of judging which we
have not, for little of Ennius, and nothing of the old Satire,
remains.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to pursue the history of Satire farther
in this place, or to speak of another species of it, the Varronian,
or, as Varro himself called it, the Menippean, which
branched out from the former, and was a medley of prose and
verse; it will be a more pleasing, as well as a more useful
employ, to enter a little into what Dryden, I know not for
what reason, calls the most difficult part of his undertaking&mdash;"a
comparative view of the Satirists;" not certainly with the
design of depressing one at the expense of another (for, though
I have translated Juvenal, I have no quarrel with Horace and
Persius), but for the purpose of pointing out the characteristic
excellencies and defects of them all. To do this the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>effectually, it will be previously necessary to take a cursory
view of the times in which their respective works were produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucilius</span>, to whom Horace, forgetting what he had said in
another place, attributes the invention of Satire, flourished in
the interval between the siege of Carthage and the defeat of
the Cimbri and Teutons, by Marius. He lived therefore in an
age in which the struggle between the old and new manners,
though daily becoming more equal, or rather inclining to the
worse side, was still far from being decided. The freedom of
speaking and writing was yet unchecked by fear, or by any
law more precise than that which, as has been already mentioned,
was introduced to restrain the coarse ebullitions of
rustic malignity. Add to this, that Lucilius was of a most
respectable family (he was great-uncle to Pompey), and lived
in habits of intimacy with the chiefs of the republic, with
Lælius, Scipio, and others, who were well able to protect him
from the Lupi and Mutii of the day, had they attempted, which
they probably did not, to silence or molest him. Hence that
boldness of satirizing the vicious by name, which startled
Horace, and on which Juvenal and Persius delight to felicitate
him.</p>

<p>Too little remains of Lucilius, to enable us to judge of his
manner: his style seems, however, to bear fewer marks of
delicacy than of strength, and his strictures appear harsh and
violent. With all this, he must have been an extraordinary
man; since Horace, who is evidently hurt by his reputation,
can say nothing worse of his compositions than that they are
careless and hasty, and that if he had lived at a more refined
period, he would have partaken of the general amelioration.
I do not remember to have heard it observed, but I suspect
that there was something of political spleen in the excessive
popularity of Lucilius under Augustus, and something of
courtly complacency in the attempt of Horace to counteract
it. Augustus enlarged the law of the twelve tables respecting
libels; and the people, who found themselves thus abridged
of the liberty of satirizing the great by name, might not improbably
seek to avenge themselves by an overstrained attachment
to the works of a man who, living, as they would
insinuate, in better times, practiced without fear, what he
enjoyed without restraint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>The space between Horace and his predecessor, was a
dreadful interval "filled up with horror all, and big with
death." Luxury and a long train of vices, which followed
the immense wealth incessantly poured in from the conquered
provinces, sapped the foundations of the republic, which were
finally shaken to pieces by the civil wars, the perpetual dictatorship
of Cæsar, and the second triumvirate, which threw
the Roman world, without a hope of escape, into the power
of an individual.</p>

<p>Augustus, whose sword was yet reeking with the best blood
of the state, now that submission left him no excuse for farther
cruelty, was desirous of enjoying in tranquillity the fruits
of his guilt. He displayed, therefore, a magnificence hitherto
unknown; and his example, which was followed by his ministers,
quickly spread among the people, who were not very
unwilling to exchange the agitation and terror of successive
proscriptions, for the security and quiet of undisputed despotism.</p>

<p>Tiberius had other views, and other methods of accomplishing
them. He did not indeed put an actual stop to the elegant
institutions of his predecessor, but he surveyed them with silent
contempt, and they rapidly degenerated. The race of informers
multiplied with dreadful celerity; and danger, which could
only be averted by complying with a caprice not always easy
to discover, created an abject disposition, fitted for the reception
of the grossest vices, and eminently favorable to the
designs of the emperor; which were to procure, by universal
depravation, that submission which Augustus sought to obtain
by the blandishments of luxury and the arts.</p>

<p>From this gloomy and suspicious tyrant, the empire was
transferred to a profligate madman. It can scarcely be told
without indignation, that when the sword of Chærea had freed
the earth from his disgraceful sway, the senate had not sufficient
virtue to resume the rights of which they had been
deprived; but, after a timid debate, delivered up the state to
a pedantic dotard, incapable of governing himself.</p>

<p>To the vices of his predecessors, Nero added a frivolity
which rendered his reign at once odious and contemptible.
Depravity could reach no farther, but misery might yet be
extended. This was fully experienced through the turbulent
and murderous usurpations of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
when the accession of Vespasian and Titus gave the groaning
world a temporary respite.</p>

<p>To these succeeded Domitian, whose crimes form the subject
of many a melancholy page in the ensuing work, and need
not therefore be dwelt on here. Under him, every trace of
ancient manners was obliterated; liberty was unknown, law
openly trampled upon, and, while the national rites were either
neglected or contemned, a base and blind superstition took
possession of the enfeebled and distempered mind.</p>

<p>Better times followed. Nerva, and Trajan, and Hadrian,
and the Antonines, restored the Romans to safety and tranquillity;
but they could do no more; liberty and virtue were
gone forever; and after a short period of comparative happiness,
which they scarcely appear to have deserved, and which
brought with it no amelioration of mind, no return of the
ancient modesty and frugality, they were finally resigned to
destruction.</p>

<p>I now proceed to the "comparative view" of which I have
already spoken: as the subject has been so often treated, little
of novelty can be expected from it; to read, compare, and
judge, is almost all that remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace</span>, who was gay, and lively, and gentle, and affectionate,
seems fitted for the period in which he wrote. He
had seen the worst times of the republic, and might therefore,
with no great suspicion of his integrity, be allowed to acquiesce
in the infant monarchy, which brought with it stability,
peace, and pleasure. How he reconciled himself to his political
tergiversation it is useless to inquire.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> What was so
general, we may suppose, brought with it but little obloquy;
and it should be remembered, to his praise, that he took no
active part in the government which he had once opposed.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>

<p>If he celebrates the master of the world, it is not until he is
asked by him whether he is ashamed that posterity should
know them to be friends; and he declines a post, which few
of his detractors have merit to deserve, or virtue to refuse.</p>

<p>His choice of privacy, however, was in some measure constitutional;
for he had an easiness of temper which bordered
on indolence; hence he never rises to the dignity of a decided
character. Zeno and Epicurus share his homage and undergo
his ridicule by turns: he passes without difficulty from one
school to another, and he thinks it a sufficient excuse for his
versatility, that he continues, amid every change, the zealous
defender of virtue. Virtue, however, abstractedly considered,
has few obligations to his zeal.</p>

<p>But though, as an ethical writer, Horace has not many
claims to the esteem of posterity; as a critic, he is entitled to
all our veneration. Such is the soundness of his judgment,
the correctness of his taste, and the extent and variety of his
knowledge, that a body of criticism might be selected from
his works, more perfect in its kind than any thing which
antiquity has bequeathed us.</p>

<p>As he had little warmth of temper, he reproves his contemporaries
without harshness. He is content to "dwell in
decencies," and, like Pope's courtly dean, "never mentions
hell to ears polite." Persius, who was infinitely better acquainted
with him than we can pretend to be, describes him,
I think, with great happiness:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tangit, et admissus circum præcordia ludit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Callidus excusso populum suspendere naso."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He, with a sly insinuating grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh'd at his friend, and look'd him in the face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would raise a blush, where secret vice he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tickle, while he gently probed the wound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With seeming innocence the crowd beguiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But made the desperate passes when he smiled."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>These beautiful lines have a defect under which Dryden's
translations frequently labor; they do not give the true sense
of the original. Horace "raised no blush" (at least Persius
does not insinuate any such thing), and certainly "made no
desperate passes."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His aim rather seems to be, to keep the
objects of his satire in good humor with himself, and with one
another.</p>

<p>To raise a laugh at vice, however (supposing it feasible),
is not the legitimate office of Satire, which is to hold up the
vicious, as objects of reprobation and scorn, for the example
of others, who may be deterred by their sufferings. But it is
time to be explicit. To laugh even at fools is superfluous;
if they understand you, they will join in the merriment; but
more commonly, they will sit with vacant unconcern, and gaze
at their own pictures: to laugh at the vicious, is to encourage
them; for there is in such men a willfulness of disposition,
which prompts them to bear up against shame, and to show
how little they regard slight reproof, by becoming more audacious
in guilt. Goodness, of which the characteristic is
modesty, may, I fear, be shamed; but vice, like folly, to be
restrained, must be overawed. Labeo, says Hall, with great
energy and beauty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Labeo is whipt, and laughs me in the face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why? for I smite, and hide the galled place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gird but the Cynic's helmet on his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cares he for Talus, or his flayle of lead?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Persius</span>, who borrowed so much of Horace's language, has
little of his manner. The immediate object of his imitation
seems to be Lucilius; and if he lashes vice with less severity
than his great prototype, the cause must not be sought in any
desire to spare what he so evidently condemned. But he was
thrown "on evil times;" he was, besides, of a rank distinguished
enough to make his freedom dangerous, and of an
age when life had yet lost little of its novelty; to write,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
therefore, even as he has written, proves him to be a person
of very singular courage and virtue.</p>

<p>In the interval between Horace and Persius, despotism had
changed its nature: the chains which the policy of Augustus
concealed in flowers, were now displayed in all their hideousness.
The arts were neglected, literature of every kind discouraged
or disgraced, and terror and suspicion substituted
in the place of the former ease and security. Stoicism, which
Cicero accuses of having infected poetry, even in his days,
and of which the professors, as Quintilian observes, always
disregarded the graces and elegancies of composition, spread
with amazing rapidity.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In this school Persius was educated,
under the care of one of its most learned and respectable
masters.</p>

<p>Satire was not his first pursuit; indeed, he seems to have
somewhat mistaken his talents when he applied to it. The
true end of this species of writing, as Dusaulx justly says,
is the improvement of society; but for this, much knowledge
of mankind ("quicquid agunt homines") is previously necessary.
Whoever is deficient in that, may be an excellent moral
and philosophical poet; but can not, with propriety, lay claim
to the honors of a satirist.</p>

<p>And Persius was moral and philosophical in a high degree:
he was also a poet of no mean order. But while he grew pale
over the page of Zeno, and Cleanthes, and Chrysippus; while
he imbibed, with all the ardor of a youthful mind, the paradoxes
of those great masters, together with their principles,
the foundations of civil society were crumbling around him,
and soliciting his attention in vain. To judge from what he
has left us, it might almost be affirmed that he was a stranger
in his own country. The degradation of Rome was now complete;
yet he felt, at least he expresses, no indignation at the
means by which it was effected: a sanguinary buffoon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
lording it over the prostrate world; yet he continued to waste
his most elaborate efforts on the miserable pretensions of pedants
in prose and verse! If this savor of the impassibility
of Stoicism, it is entitled to no great praise on the score of
outraged humanity, which has stronger claims on a well-regulated
mind, than criticism, or even philosophy.</p>

<p>Dryden gives that praise to the dogmas of Persius, which
he denies to his poetry. "His verse," he says, "is scabrous
and hobbling, and his measures beneath those of Horace."
This is too severe; for Persius has many exquisite passages,
which nothing in Horace will be found to equal or approach.
The charge of obscurity has been urged against him with
more justice; though this, perhaps, is not so great as it is
usually represented. Casaubon could, without question, have
defended him more successfully than he has done; but he was
overawed by the brutal violence of the elder Scaliger; for I
can scarcely persuade myself that he really believed this obscurity
to be owing to "the fear of Nero, or the advice of
Cornutus." The cause of it should be rather sought in his
natural disposition, and in his habits of thinking. Generally
speaking, however, it springs from a too frequent use of
tropes, approaching in almost every instance to a catachresis,
an anxiety of compression, and a quick and unexpected transition
from one overstrained figure to another. After all,
with the exception of the sixth Satire, which, from its abruptness,
does not appear to have received the author's last
touches, I do not think there is much to confound an attentive
reader: some acquaintance, indeed, with the porch "braccatis
illita Medis," is previously necessary. His life may be contemplated
with unabated pleasure: the virtue he recommends,
he practiced in the fullest extent; and at an age when few
have acquired a determinate character, he left behind him an
established reputation for genius, learning, and worth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juvenal</span> wrote at a period still more detestable than that
of Persius. Domitian, who now governed the empire, seems
to have inherited the bad qualities of all his predecessors.
Tiberius was not more hypocritical, nor Caligula more bloody,
nor Claudius more sottish, nor Nero more mischievous, than
this ferocious despot; who, as Theodorus Gadareus indignantly
declared of Tiberius, was truly πηλον αἱματι πεφυραμενον·
a lump of clay kneaded up with blood!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Juvenal, like Persius, professes to follow Lucilius; but
what was in one a simple attempt, is in the other a real imitation,
of his manner.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Fluent and witty as Horace, grave
and sublime as Persius; of a more decided character than the
former, better acquainted with mankind than the latter; he
did not confine himself to the mode of regulating an intercourse
with the great, or to abstract disquisitions on the nature
of scholastic liberty; but, disregarding the claims of a
vain urbanity, and fixing all his soul on the eternal distinctions
of moral good and evil, he labored, with a magnificence
of language peculiar to himself, to set forth the loveliness of
virtue, and the deformity and horror of vice, in full and perfect
display.</p>

<p>Dusaulx, who is somewhat prejudiced against Horace, does
ample justice to Juvenal. There is great force in what he
says; and, as I do not know that it ever appeared in English,
I shall take the liberty of laying a part of it before the reader,
at the hazard of a few repetitions.</p>

<p>"The bloody revolution which smothered the last sighs of
liberty,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> had not yet found time to debase the minds of a
people, among whom the traditionary remains of the old
manners still subsisted. The cruel but politic Octavius scattered
flowers over the paths he was secretly tracing toward
despotism: the arts of Greece, transplanted to the Capitol,
flourished beneath his auspices; and the remembrance of so
many civil dissensions, succeeding each other with increasing
rapidity, excited a degree of reverence for the author of this
unprecedented tranquillity. The Romans felicitated themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>at not lying down, as before, with an apprehension of
finding themselves included, when they awoke, in the list of
proscription: and neglected, amid the amusements of the circus
and the theatre, those civil rights of which their fathers
had been so jealous.</p>

<p>"Profiting of these circumstances, Horace forgot that he
had combated on the side of liberty. A better courtier than
a soldier, he clearly saw how far the refinement, the graces,
and the cultivated state of his genius (qualities not much considered
or regarded till his time<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>), were capable of advancing
him without any extraordinary effort.</p>

<p>"Indifferent to the future, and not daring to recall the past,
he thought of nothing but securing himself from all that could
sadden the mind, and disturb the system which he had skillfully
arranged on the credit of those then in power. It is on
this account, that, of all his contemporaries, he has celebrated
none but the friends of his master, or, at least, those whom
he could praise without fear of compromising his favor.</p>

<p>"In what I have said of Horace, my chief design has been
to show that this Proteus, who counted among his friends and
admirers even those whose conduct he censured, chose rather
to capitulate than contend; that he attached no great importance
to his own rules, and adhered to his principles no longer
than they favored his views.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Juvenal</span> began his satiric career where the other finished,
that is to say, he did that for morals and liberty, which Horace
had done for decorum and taste. Disdaining artifice of every
kind, he boldly raised his voice against the usurpation of
power; and incessantly recalled the memory of the glorious
æra of independence to those degenerate Romans, who had
substituted suicide in the place of their ancient courage; and
from the days of Augustus to those of Domitian, only avenged
their slavery by an epigram or a bonmot.</p>

<p>"The characteristics of Juvenal were energy, passion, and
indignation: it is, nevertheless, easy to discover that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
sometimes more afflicted than exasperated. His great aim
was to alarm the vicious, and, if possible, to exterminate vice,
which had, as it were, acquired a legal establishment. A
noble enterprise! but he wrote in a detestable age, when the
laws of nature were publicly violated, and the love of their
country so completely eradicated from the breasts of his fellow-citizens,
that, brutified as they were by slavery and
voluptuousness, by luxury and avarice, they merited rather
the severity of the executioner than the censor.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the empire, shaken to its foundations, was
rapidly crumbling to dust. Despotism was consecrated by the
senate; liberty, of which a few slaves were still sensible, was
nothing but an unmeaning word for the rest, which, unmeaning
as it was, they did not dare to pronounce in public. Men
of rank were declared enemies to the state for having praised
their equals; historians were condemned to the cross, philosophy
was proscribed, and its professors banished. Individuals
felt only for their own danger, which they too often
averted by accusing others; and there were instances of children
who denounced their own parents, and appeared as witnesses
against them! It was not possible to weep for the
proscribed, for tears themselves became the object of proscription;
and when the tyrant of the day had condemned the
accused to banishment or death, the senate decreed that he
should be thanked for it, as for an act of singular favor.</p>

<p>"Juvenal, who looked upon the alliance of the agreeable
with the odious as utterly incompatible, contemned the feeble
weapon of ridicule, so familiar to his predecessor: he therefore
seized the sword of Satire, or, to speak more properly,
fabricated one for himself, and rushing from the palace to the
tavern, and from the gates of Rome to the boundaries of the
empire, struck, without distinction, whoever deviated from the
course of nature, or from the paths of honor. It is no longer
a poet like Horace, fickle, pliant, and fortified with that indifference
so falsely called philosophical, who amused himself
with bantering vice, or, at most, with upbraiding a few errors
of little consequence, in a style, which, scarcely raised above
the language of conversation, flowed as indolence and pleasure
directed; but a stern and incorruptible censor, an inflamed
and impetuous poet, who sometimes rises with his subject to
the noblest heights of tragedy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>From this declamatory applause, which even La Harpe
allows to be worthy of the translator of Juvenal, the most
rigid censor of our author can not detract much; nor can
much perhaps be added to it by his warmest admirer. I
could, indeed, have wished that he had not exalted him at the
expense of Horace; but something must be allowed for the
partiality of long acquaintance; and Casaubon, when he preferred
Persius, with whom he had taken great, and indeed
successful pains, to Horace and Juvenal, sufficiently exposed,
while he tacitly accounted for, the prejudices of commentators
and translators. With respect to Horace, if he falls beneath
Juvenal (and who does not?) in eloquence, in energy, and in
a vivid and glowing imagination, he evidently surpasses him
in taste and critical judgment. I could pursue the parallel
through a thousand ramifications, but the reader who does me
the honor to peruse the following sheets, will see that I have
incidentally touched upon some of them in the notes: and,
indeed, I preferred scattering my observations through the
work, as they arose from the subject, to bringing them together
in this place; where they must evidently have lost
something of their pertinency, without much certainty of
gaining in their effect.</p>

<p>Juvenal is accused of being too sparing of praise. But are
his critics well assured that praise from Juvenal could be accepted
with safety? I do not know that a private station was
"the post of honor" in those days; it was, however, that of
security. Martial, Statius, V. Flaccus, and other parasites
of Domitian, might indeed venture to celebrate their friends,
who were also those of the emperor. Juvenal's, it is probable,
were of another kind; and he might have been influenced
no less by humanity than prudence, in the sacred silence
which he has observed respecting them. Let it not be forgotten,
however, that this intrepid champion of virtue, who, under
the twelfth despot, persisted, as Dusaulx observes, in recognizing
no sovereign but the senate, while he passes by those
whose safety his applause might endanger, has generously
celebrated the ancient assertors of liberty, in strains that
Tyrtæus might have wished his own.</p>

<p>He is also charged with being too rhetorical in his language.
The critics have discovered that he practiced at the bar, and
they will therefore have it that his Satires smack of his pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>fession,
"redolent declamatorem."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> That he is luxuriant, or,
if it must be so, redundant, may be safely granted; but I
doubt whether the passages which are cited for proofs of this
fault, were not reckoned among his beauties by his contemporaries.
The enumeration of deities in the thirteenth Satire
is well defended by Rigaltius, who admits, at the same time,
that if the author had inserted it any where but in a Satire,
he should have accounted him a babbler; "faterer Juv. hic
περιλαλον fuisse et verborum prodigum." He appears to me
equally successful, in justifying the list of oaths in the same
Satire, which Creech, it appears, had not the courage to
translate.</p>

<p>The other passages adduced in support of this charge, are
either metaphorical exaggerations, or long traits of indirect
Satire, of which Juvenal was as great a master as Horace.
I do not say that these are interesting to us; but they were
eminently so to those for whom they were written; and by
their pertinency at the time, should they, by every rule of fair
criticism, be estimated. The version of such passages is one
of the miseries of translation.</p>

<p>I have also heard it objected to Juvenal, that there is in
many of his Satires a want of arrangement; this is particularly
observed of the sixth and tenth. I scarcely know what to
reply to this. Those who are inclined to object, would not
be better satisfied, perhaps, if the form of both were changed;
for I suspect that there is no natural gradation in the innumerable
passions which agitate the human breast. Some
must precede, and others follow; but the order of march is
not, nor ever was, invariable. While I acquit him of this,
however, I readily acknowledge a want of care in many places,
unless it be rather attributable to a want of taste. On some
occasions, too, when he changed or enlarged his first sketch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
he forgot to strike out the unnecessary verses: to this are
owing the repetitions to be found in his longer works, as well
as the transpositions, which have so often perplexed the critics
and translators.</p>

<p>Now I am upon this subject, I must not pass over a slovenliness
in some of his lines, for which he has been justly reproached
by Jortin and others, as it would have cost him no
great pains to improve them. Why he should voluntarily debase
his poetry, it is difficult to say: if he thought that he
was imitating Horace in his laxity, his judgment must suffer
considerably. The verses of Horace are indeed akin to prose;
but as he seldom rises, he has the art of making his low flights,
in which all his motions are easy and graceful, appear the
effect of choice. Juvenal was qualified to "sit where he dared
not soar." His element was that of the eagle, "descent and
fall to him were adverse," and, indeed, he never appears more
awkward than when he flutters, or rather waddles, along the
ground.</p>

<p>I have observed in the course of the translation, that he
embraced no sect with warmth. In a man of such lively passions,
the retention with which he speaks of them all, is to be
admired. From his attachment to the writings of Seneca, I
should incline to think that he leaned toward Stoicism; his
predilection for the school, however, was not very strong:
perhaps it is to be wished that he had entered a little more
deeply into it, as he seems not to have those distinct ideas of
the nature of virtue and vice, which were entertained by many
of the ancient philosophers, and indeed, by his immediate predecessor,
Persius. As a general champion for virtue, he is
commonly successful, but he sometimes misses his aim; and,
in more than one instance, confounds the nature of the several
vices in his mode of attacking them: he confounds too the
very essence of virtue, which, in his hands, has often "no
local habitation and name," but varies with the ever-varying
passions and caprices of mankind. I know not whether it be
worth while to add, that he is accused of holding a different
language at different times respecting the gods, since in this
he differs little from the Greek and Roman poets in general;
who, as often as they introduce their divinities, state, as Juvenal
does, the mythological circumstances coupled with their
names, without regard to the existing system of physic or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
morals. When they speak from themselves, indeed, they give
us exalted sentiments of virtue and sound philosophy; when
they indulge in poetic recollections, they present us with the
fables of antiquity. Hence the gods are alternately, and as
the subject requires, venerable or contemptible; and this could
not but happen through the want of some acknowledged religious
standard, to which all might with confidence refer.</p>

<p>I come now to a more serious charge against Juvenal, that
of indecency. To hear the clamor raised against him, it
might be supposed, by one unacquainted with the times, that
he was the only indelicate writer of his age and country. Yet
Horace and Persius wrote with equal grossness: yet the rigid
Stoicism of Seneca did not deter him from the use of expressions,
which Juvenal perhaps would have rejected: yet the
courtly Pliny poured out gratuitous indecencies in his frigid
hendecasyllables, which he attempts to justify by the example
of a writer to whose freedom the licentiousness of Juvenal is
purity! It seems as if there was something of pique in the
singular severity with which he is censured. His pure and
sublime morality operates as a tacit reproach on the generality
of mankind, who seek to indemnify themselves by questioning
the sanctity which they can not but respect; and find a secret
pleasure in persuading one another that "this dreaded satirist"
was at heart no inveterate enemy to the licentiousness
which he so vehemently reprehends.</p>

<p>When we consider the unnatural vices at which Juvenal
directs his indignation, and reflect, at the same time, on the peculiar
qualities of his mind, we shall not find much cause, perhaps,
for wonder at the strength of his expressions. I should
resign him in silence to the hatred of mankind, if his aim, like
that of too many others, whose works are read with delight,
had been to render vice amiable, to fling his seducing colors
over impurity, and inflame the passions by meretricious hints
at what is only innoxious when exposed in native deformity:
but when I find that his views are to render depravity loathsome;
that every thing which can alarm and disgust is directed
at her in his terrible page, I forget the grossness of the
execution in the excellence of the design; and pay my involuntary
homage to that integrity, which fearlessly calling in
strong description to the aid of virtue, attempts to purify the
passions, at the hazard of wounding delicacy and offending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
taste. This is due to Juvenal: in justice to myself, let me
add, that I could have been better pleased to have had no
occasion to speak at all on the subject.</p>

<p>Whether any considerations of this or a similar nature deterred
our literati from turning these Satires into English, I
can not say; but, though partial versions might be made, it
was not until the beginning of the seventeenth century that a
complete translation was thought of; when two men, of celebrity
in their days, undertook it about the same time; these
were Barten Holyday and Sir Robert Stapylton. Who entered
first upon the task, can not well be told. There appears
somewhat of a querulousness on both sides; a jealousy that
their versions had been communicated in manuscript to each
other: Stapylton's, however, was first published, though that
of Holyday seems to have been first finished.</p>

<p>Of this ingenious man it is not easy to speak with too much
respect. His learning, industry, judgment, and taste are
every where conspicuous: nor is he without a very considerable
portion of shrewdness to season his observations. His
poetry indeed, or rather his ill-measured prose, is intolerable;
no human patience can toil through a single page of it;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> but
his notes will always be consulted with pleasure. His work
has been of considerable use to the subsequent editors of
Juvenal, both at home and abroad; and indeed, such is its
general accuracy, that little excuse remains for any notorious
deviation from the sense of the original.</p>

<p>Stapylton had equal industry, and more poetry; but he
wanted his learning, judgment, and ingenuity. His notes,
though numerous, are trite, and scarcely beyond the reach of
a schoolboy. He is besides scandalously indecent on many
occasions, where his excellent rival was innocently unfaithful,
or silent.</p>

<p>With these translations, such as they were, the public was
satisfied until the end of the seventeenth century, when the
necessity of something more poetical becoming apparent, the
booksellers, as Johnson says, "proposed a new version to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
poets of that time, which was undertaken by Dryden, whose
reputation was such, that no man was unwilling to serve the
Muses under him."</p>

<p>Dryden's account of this translation is given with such candor,
in the exquisite dedication which precedes it, that I shall
lay it before the reader in his own words.</p>

<p>"The common way which we have taken, is not a literal
translation, but a kind of paraphrase, or somewhat which
is yet more loose, betwixt a paraphrase and a translation.
Thus much may be said for us, that if we give not the whole
sense of Juvenal, yet we give the most considerable part of
it: we give it, in general, so clearly, that few notes are sufficient
to make us intelligible: we make our author at least
appear in a poetic dress. We have actually made him more
sounding, and more elegant, than he was before in English:
and have endeavored to make him speak that kind of English,
which he would have spoken had he lived in England, and had
written to this age. If sometimes any of us (and it is but
seldom) make him express the customs and manners of his
native country rather than of Rome, it is, either when there
was some kind of analogy betwixt their customs and ours, or
when, to make him more easy to vulgar understandings, we
gave him those manners which are familiar to us. But I defend
not this innovation, it is enough if I can excuse it. For
to speak sincerely, the manners of nations and ages are not to
be confounded."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>This is, surely, sufficiently modest. Johnson's description
of it is somewhat more favorable: "The general character
of this translation will be given, when it is said to preserve the
wit, but to want the dignity, of the original." Is this correct?
Dryden frequently degrades the author into a jester; bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>t
Juvenal has few moments of levity. Wit, indeed, he possesses
in an eminent degree, but it is tinctured with his peculiarities;
"rarò jocos," as Lipsius well observes, "sæpius acerbos sales
miscet." Dignity is the predominant quality of his mind: he
can, and does, relax with grace, but he never forgets himself;
he smiles, indeed; but his smile is more terrible than his frown,
for it is never excited but when his indignation is mingled
with contempt; "ridet et odit!" Where his dignity, therefore,
is wanting, his wit will be imperfectly preserved.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, there is nothing in this quotation to deter
succeeding writers from attempting, at least, to supply the
deficiencies of Dryden and his fellow-laborers; and, perhaps,
I could point out several circumstances which might make it
laudable, if not necessary: but this would be to trifle with
the reader, who is already apprised that, as far as relates to
myself, no motives but those of obedience determined me to
the task for which I now solicit the indulgence of the public.</p>

<p>When I took up this author, I knew not of any other translator;
nor was it until the scheme of publishing him was
started, that I began to reflect seriously on the nature of what
I had undertaken, to consider by what exertions I could render
that useful which was originally meant to amuse, and
justify, in some measure, the partiality of my benefactors.</p>

<p>My first object was to become as familiar as possible with
my author, of whom I collected every edition that my own
interest, or that of my friends, could procure; together with
such translations as I could discover either here or abroad;
from a careful examination of all these, I formed the plan, to
which, while I adapted my former labors, I anxiously strove
to accommodate my succeeding ones.</p>

<p>Dryden has said, "if we give not the whole, yet we give
the most considerable part of it." My determination was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
give the whole, and really make the work what it professed to
be, a translation of Juvenal. I had seen enough of castrated
editions, to observe that little was gained by them on the score
of propriety; since, when the author was reduced to half his
bulk, at the expense of his spirit and design, sufficient remained
to alarm the delicacy for which the sacrifice had been
made. Chaucer observes with great naiveté,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whoso shall tell a tale after a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He moste reherse as neighe as ever he can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everich word, if it be in his charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All speke he never so rudely and so large."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And indeed the age of Chaucer, like that of Juvenal, allowed
of such liberties. Other times, other manners. Many
words were in common use with our ancestors, which raised
no improper ideas, though they would not, and indeed could
not, at this time be tolerated. With the Greeks and Romans
it was still worse: their dress, which left many parts of the
body exposed, gave a boldness to their language, which was
not perhaps lessened by the infrequency of women at those
social conversations, of which they now constitute the refinement
and the delight. Add to this that their mythology, and
sacred rites, which took their rise in very remote periods,
abounded in the undisguised phrases of a rude and simple age,
and being religiously handed down from generation to generation,
gave a currency to many terms, which offered no violence
to modesty, though abstractedly considered by people of
a different language and manners, they appear pregnant with
turpitude and guilt.</p>

<p>When we observe this licentiousness (for I should wrong
many of the ancient writers to call it libertinism) in the pages
of their historians and philosophers, we may be pretty confident
that it raised no blush on the cheek of their readers. It
was the language of the times&mdash;"hæc illis natura est omnibus
una:" and if it be considered as venial in those, surely a little
farther indulgence will not be misapplied to the satirist, whose
object is the exposure of what the former have only to notice.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for Juvenal: but shame and sorrow
on the head of him who presumes to transfer his grossness
into the vernacular tongues! "Legimus aliqua ne legantur,"
was said of old, by one of a pure and zealous mind. Without
pretending to his high motives, I have felt the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
his example, and in his apology must therefore hope to find
my own. Though the poet be given entire, I have endeavored
to make him speak as he would probably have spoken if he
had lived among us; when, refined with the age, he would
have fulminated against impurity in terms, to which, though
delicacy might disavow them, manly decency might listen
without offense.</p>

<p>I have said above, that "the whole of Juvenal" is here
given; this, however, must be understood with a few restrictions.
Where vice, of whatever nature, formed the immediate
object of reprobation, it has not been spared in the translation;
but I have sometimes taken the liberty of omitting an
exceptionable line, when it had no apparent connection with
the subject of the Satire. Some acquaintance with the original
will be necessary to discover these lacunæ, which do not, in
all, amount to half a page: for the rest, I have no apologies
to make. Here are no allusions, covert or open, to the follies
and vices of modern times; nor has the dignity of the original
been prostituted, in a single instance, to the gratification of
private spleen.</p>

<p>I have attempted to follow, as far as I judged it feasible,
the style of my author, which is more various than is usually
supposed. It is not necessary to descend to particulars; but
my meaning will be understood by those who carefully compare
the original of the thirteenth and fourteenth Satires with
the translation. In the twelfth, and in that alone, I have
perhaps raised it a little; but it really appears so contemptible
a performance in the doggerel of Dryden's coadjutor, that
I thought somewhat more attention than ordinary was in justice
due to it. It is not a chef-d'œuvre by any means; but it
is a pretty and a pleasing little poem, deserving more notice
than it has usually received.</p>

<p>I could have been sagacious and obscure on many occasions,
with very little difficulty; but I strenuously combated every
inclination to find out more than my author meant. The
general character of this translation, if I do not deceive myself,
will be found to be plainness; and, indeed, the highest
praise to which I aspire, is that of having left the original
more intelligible to the English reader than I found it.</p>

<p>On numbering the lines, I find that my translation contains
a few less than Dryden's. Had it been otherwise, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
not have thought an apology necessary, nor would it perhaps
appear extraordinary, when it is considered that I have introduced
an infinite number of circumstances from the text,
which he thought himself justified in omitting; and that, with
the trifling exceptions already mentioned, nothing has been
passed; whereas he and his assistants overlooked whole sections,
and sometimes very considerable ones.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Every where,
too, I have endeavored to render the transitions less abrupt,
and to obviate or disguise the difficulties which a difference
of manners, habits, etc., necessarily creates: all this calls for
an additional number of lines; which the English reader, at
least, will seldom have occasion to regret.</p>

<p>Of the "borrowed learning of notes," which Dryden says
he avoided as much as possible, I have amply availed myself.
During the long period in which my thoughts were fixed on
Juvenal, it was usual with me, whenever I found a passage
that related to him, to impress it on my memory, or to note it
down. These, on the revision of the work for publication,
were added to such reflections as arose in my own mind, and
arranged in the manner in which they now appear. I confess
that this was not an unpleasant task to me, and I will venture
to hope, that if my own suggestions fail to please, yet the frequent
recurrence of some of the most striking and beautiful
passages of ancient and modern poetry, history, etc., will render
it neither unamusing nor uninstructive to the general
reader. The information insinuated into the mind by miscellaneous
collections of this nature, is much greater than is
usually imagined; and I have been frequently encouraged to
proceed by recollecting the benefits which I formerly derived
from casual notices scattered over the margin, or dropped at
the bottom of a page.</p>

<p>In this compilation, I proceeded on no regular plan, farther
than considering what, if I had been a mere English reader,
I should wish to have had explained: it is therefore extremely
probable, as every rule of this nature must be imperfect, that
I have frequently erred; have spoken where I should be silent
and been prolix where I should be brief: on the whole, however,
I chose to offend on the safer side; and to leave nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
unsaid, at the hazard of sometimes saying too much. Tedious,
perhaps, I may be; but, I trust, not dull; and with this negative
commendation I must be satisfied. The passages produced
are not always translated; but the English reader
needs not for that be discouraged in proceeding, as he will
frequently find sufficient in the context to give him a general
idea of the meaning. In many places I have copied the words,
together with the sentiments of the writer; for this, if it call
for an apology, I shall take that of Macrobius, who had somewhat
more occasion for it than I shall be found to have: "Nec
mihi vitio vertas, si res quas ex lectione varia mutuabor, ipsis
sæpè verbis quibus ab ipsis auctoribus enarratæ sunt explicabo,
quia præsens opus non eloquentiæ ostentationem, sed
noscendorum congeriem pollicetur," etc. Saturn., lib. i., c. 1.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now said all that occurs to me on this subject: a
more pleasing one remains. I can not, indeed, like Dryden,
boast of my poetical coadjutors. No Congreves and Creeches
have abridged, while they adorned, my labors; yet have I
not been without assistance, and of the most valuable kind.</p>

<p>Whoever is acquainted with the habits of intimacy in which
I have lived from early youth with the Rev. Dr. Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
will not want to be informed of his share in the following
pages. To those who are not, it is proper to say, that besides
the passages in which he is introduced by name, every other
part of the work has been submitted to his inspection. Nor
would his affectionate anxiety for the reputation of his friend
suffer any part of the translation to appear, without undergoing
the strictest revision. His uncommon accuracy, judgment,
and learning have been uniformly exerted on it, not less, I
am confident, to the advantage of the reader, than to my own
satisfaction. It will be seen that we sometimes differ in
opinion; but as I usually distrust my own judgment in those
cases, the decision is submitted to the reader.</p>

<p>I have also to express my obligations to Abraham Moore,
Esq., barrister at law, a gentleman whose taste and learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
are well known to be only surpassed by his readiness to oblige:
of which I have the most convincing proofs; since the hours
dedicated to the following sheets (which I lament that he only
saw in their progress through the press) were snatched from
avocations as urgent as they were important.</p>

<p>Nor must I overlook the friendly assistance of William
Porden, Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> which, like that of the former gentleman, was
given to me, amid the distraction of more immediate concerns,
with a readiness that enhanced the worth of what was,
in itself, highly valuable.</p>

<p>A paper was put into my hand by Mr. George Nicol, the
promoter of every literary work, from R. P. Knight, Esq.,
containing subjects for engravings illustrative of Juvenal, and,
with singular generosity, offering me the use of his marbles,
gems, etc. As these did not fall within my plan, I can only
here return him my thanks for a kindness as extraordinary
as it was unexpected. But I have other and greater obligations
to Mr. Nicol. In conjunction with his son, Mr. William
Nicol, he has watched the progress of this work through the
press with unwearied solicitude. During my occasional absences
from town, the correction of it (for which, indeed, the
state of my eyes renders me at all times rather unfit) rested
almost solely on him; and it is but justice to add, that his
habitual accuracy in this ungrateful employ is not the only
quality to which I am bound to confess my obligations.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The origin of this word is now acknowledged to be Roman. Scaliger
derived it from σατυρος (<em>satyrus</em>), but Casaubon, Dacier, and others, more
reasonably, from <em>satura</em> (fem. of <em>satur</em>), rich, abounding, full of variety.
In this sense it was applied to the lanx or charger, in which the various
productions of the soil were offered up to the gods; and thus came to be
used for any miscellaneous collection in general. <em>Satura olla</em>, a hotch-potch;
<em>saturæ leges</em>, laws comprehending a multitude of regulations, etc.
This deduction of the name may serve to explain, in some measure, the
nature of the first Satires, which treated of various subjects, and were
full of various matters: but enough on this trite topic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> It should be observed, however, that the idea was obvious, and the
work itself highly necessary. The old Satire, amid much coarse ribaldry,
frequently attacked the follies and vices of the day. This could not
be done by the comedy which superseded it, and which, by a strange
perversity of taste, was never rendered national. Its customs, manners,
nay, its very plots, were Grecian; and scarcely more applicable to the
Romans than to us.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> To extend this to Lucilius, as is sometimes done, is absurd, since he
evidently had in view the old comedy of the Greeks, of which his Satires,
according to Horace, were rigid imitations:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Eupolis atque Cratinus, Aristophanesque poëtæ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atque alii, quorum comœdia prisca virorum est;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si quia erat dignus describi, quod malus, aut fur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quod mœchus foret, aut sicarius, aut alioqui<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famosus, multa cum libertate notabant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Hinc</span> omnis pendet Lucilius, hosce secutus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mutatis tantum pedibus, numerisque."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Here the matter would seem to be at once determined by a very competent
judge. Strip the old Greek comedy of its action, and change the
metre from Iambic to Heroic, and you have the Roman Satire! It is
evident from this, that, unless two things be granted, first, that the actors
in those ancient Satires were ignorant of the existence of the Greek
comedy; and, secondly, that Ennius, who knew it well, passed it by for
a ruder model; the Romans can have no pretensions to the honor they
claim.
</p>
<p>
And even if this be granted, the honor appears to be scarcely worth
the claiming; for the Greeks had not only Dramatic, but Lyric and Heroic
Satire. To pass by the Margites, what were the Iambics of Archilochus,
and the Scazons of Hipponax, but Satires? nay, what were the Silli?
Casaubon derives them απο του σιλλαινειν, to scoff, to treat petulantly;
and there is no doubt of the justness of his derivation. These little pieces
were made up of passages from various poems, which by slight alterations
were humorously or satirically applied at will. The Satires of Ennius
were probably little more; indeed, we have the express authority of Diomedes
the grammarian for it. After speaking of Lucilius, whose writings
he derives, with Horace, from the old comedy, he adds, "et olim
carmen, quod ex variis poematibus constabat, satira vocabatur; quale
scripserunt Pacuvius et Ennius." Modern critics agree in understanding
"ex variis poematibus," of various kinds of metre; but I do not see
why it may not mean, as I have rendered it, "of various poems;" unless
we choose to compliment the Romans, by supposing that what was in
the Greeks a mere cento, was in them an original composition.
</p>
<p>
It would scarcely be doing justice, however, to Ennius, to suppose that
he did not surpass his models, for, to say the truth, the Greek Silli appear
to have been no very extraordinary performances. A few short
specimens of them may be seen in Diogenes Laertius, and a longer one,
which has escaped the writers on this subject, in Dio Chrysostom. As
this is, perhaps, the only Greek Satire extant, it may be regarded as a
curiosity; and as such, for as a literary effort it is worth nothing, a short
extract from it may not be uninteresting. Sneering at the people of
Alexandria, for their mad attachment to chariot-races, etc., he says, this
folly of theirs is not ill exposed by one of those scurrilous writers of (Silli,
or) parodies: ου κακως τις παρεποιησε των σαπρων τουτων ποιητων·

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> I doubt whether he was ever a good royalist at heart; he frequently,
perhaps unconsciously, betrays a lurking dissatisfaction; but having, as
Johnson says of a much greater man, "tasted the honey of favor," he
did not choose to return to hunger and philosophy. Indeed, he was not
happy; in the country he sighs for the town, in town for the country;
and he is always restless, and straining after something which he never
obtains. To float, like Aristippus, with the stream, is a bad recipe for
felicity; there must be some fixed principle, by which the passions and
desires may be regulated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> He is careful to disclaim all participation in public affairs. He accompanies
Mæcenas in his carriage; but their chat, he wishes it to be
believed, is on the common topics of the day, the weather, amusements,
etc. Though this may not be strictly true, it is yet probable that politics
furnished but a small part of their conversation. That both Augustus
and his minister were warmly attached to him, can not be denied; but
then it was as to a plaything. In a word, Horace seems to have been
the "enfant gaté," of the palace, and was viewed, I believe, with more
tenderness than respect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Mr. Drummond has given this passage with equal elegance and
truth:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With greater art sly Horace gain'd his end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But spared no failing of his smiling friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sportive and pleasant round the heart he play'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrapt in jests the censure he convey'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such address his willing victims seized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tickled fools were rallied, and were pleased."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Dusaulx accounts for this by the general consternation. Most of
those, he says, distinguished for talents or rank, took refuge in the school
of Zeno; not so much to learn in it how to live, as how to die. I think,
on the contrary, that this would rather have driven them into the arms
of Epicurus. "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," will generally
be found, I believe, to be the maxim of dangerous times. It would
not be difficult to show, if this were the place for it, that the prevalency
of Stoicism was due to the increase of profligacy, for which it furnished
a convenient cloak. This, however, does not apply to Persius.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> I believe that Juvenal meant to describe himself in the following
spirited picture of Lucilius:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ense velut stricto quoties Lucilius ardens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infremuit, rubet auditor, cui frigida mens est<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Criminibus, tacita sudant præcordia culpa."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This is an error which has been so often repeated, that it is believed.
What liberty was destroyed by the usurpation of Augustus? For more
than half a century, Rome had been a prey to ambitious chiefs, while
five or six civil wars, each more bloody than the other, had successively
delivered up the franchises of the empire to the conqueror of the day.
The Gracchi first opened the career to ambition, and wanted nothing
but the means of corruption, which the East afterward supplied, to effect
what Marius, Sylla, and the two triumvirates brought about with sufficient
ease.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> This is a very strange observation. It looks as if Dusaulx had leaped
from the times of old Metellus to those of Augustus, without casting a
glance at the interval. The chef d'œuvres of Roman literature were in
every hand, when he supposed them to be neglected: and, indeed, if
Horace had left us nothing, the qualities of which Dusaulx speaks might
still be found in many works produced before he was known.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> I have often wished that we had some of the pleadings of Juvenal.
It can not be affirmed, I think, that there is any natural connection between
prose and verse in the same mind, though it may be observed,
that most of our celebrated poets have written admirably "solutâ oratione:"
yet if Juvenal's oratory bore any resemblance to his poetry, he
yielded to few of the best ornaments of the bar. The "torrens dicendi
copia" was his, in an eminent degree; nay, so full, so rich, so strong,
and so magnificent is his eloquence, that I have heard one well qualified
to judge, frequently declare that Cicero himself, in his estimation,
could hardly be said to surpass him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> With all my respect for the learning of the good old man, it is impossible,
now and then, to suppress a smile at his simplicity. In apologizing
for his translation, he says: "As for publishing poetry, it needs
no defense; there being, if my Lord of Verulam's judgment shall be admitted,
'a <em>divine rapture</em> in it!'"</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> He evidently alludes to the versions of the second and eighth Satires
by Tate and Stepney, but principally to the latter, in which Juvenal
illustrates his argument by the practice of Smithfield and Newmarket!
Indeed, Dryden himself, though confessedly aware of its impropriety, is
not altogether free from "innovation;" he talks of the Park, and the
Mall, and the Opera, and of many other objects, familiar to the translator,
but which the original writer could only know by the spirit of prophecy.
</p>
<p>
I am sensible how difficult it is to keep the manners of different ages
perfectly distinct in a work like this: I have never knowingly confounded
them, and, I trust, not often inadvertently; yet more occasions perhaps of
exercising the reader's candor will appear, after all, than are desirable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Yet Johnson knew him well. The peculiarity of Juvenal, he says
(vol. ix., p. 424), "is a mixture of gayety and stateliness, of pointed
sentences, and declamatory grandeur." A good idea of it may be
formed from his own beautiful imitation of the third Satire. His imitation
of the tenth (still more beautiful as a poem) has scarcely a trait of
the author's manner&mdash;that is to say, of that "mixture of gayety and
stateliness," which, according to his own definition, constitutes the "peculiarity
of Juvenal." "The Vanity of Human Wishes" is uniformly
stately and severe, and without those light and popular strokes of sarcasm
which abound so much in his "London."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> In the fourteenth Satire, for example, there is an omission of fifteen
lines, and this, too, in a passage of singular importance.</p></div>

<h2>APPENDIX, ON THE DATE OF JUVENAL'S SATIRES.</h2>


<p>The first Satire appears, from internal evidence, to have
been written subsequently to at least the larger portion of the
other Satires. But in this, as probably in many others, lines
were interpolated here and there, at a period long after the
original composition of the main body of the Satire; the cycle
of events reproducing such a combination of circumstances,
that the Satirist could make his shafts come home with two-fold
pungency. For instance, the lines 60 <em>et seq.</em>, which probably
were in the first edition of the Satire directed against
Nero and his favorite Sporus, would tell with equal effect
against Hadrian and Antinous.</p>

<p>It is impossible, therefore, from any one given passage, to
assign a date to any of the Satires of Juvenal. All that can
be done, is to point out the allusion probably intended in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
particular passages, and by that means fix a date prior to
which we may reasonably conclude that portion could not
have been written.</p>

<p>In those Satires whose subject is less complicated and extensive,
a nearer approximation may be obtained to the date
of the composition; as e. g. in the case of the second and
eleventh Satires, and we may add the thirteenth and fifteenth.</p>

<p>But in the first Satire, the allusions extend over so wide a
period, that unless we may suppose, as in the case just cited,
that other persons are intended under the names known to
history, to whom his readers would apply immediately the
covert sarcasm, we can hardly imagine that they could <em>all</em> at
any one given time serve to give point to the shaft of the
Satirist. Thus Crispinus, mentioned l. 27, was made a senator
by Nero, and lived probably under Domitian also. The barber
alluded to in l. 25 (if, as the commentators suppose, Cinnamus
is the person), must have lost all his wealth, and been
reduced to poverty, somewhere about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 93, the date of
Martial's seventh book of Epigrams (who mentions the fact,
and advises him to recur to his old trade, Ep. VII. lxiv.).
Massa and Carus (l. 35, 36) are mentioned by Martial as
apparently flourishing when he wrote his twelfth book, which
was sent to Rome <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 104. Again, line 49 seems to refer
to the condemnation of Marius as a recent event; but this
took place in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 100. And in that same year M. Cornelius
Fronto was consul with Trajan; and may have been the proprietor
of the plane-groves, mentioned l. 12. But then, again,
we hear of Julius Fronto in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 129, and Hadrian's conduct
toward Antinous in that and the following year, might well
have given occasion to the 60th and following lines; and if
we are right in applying line 40 to Plotina's manœuvring to
secure the succession to Hadrian, it will furnish an additional
argument for supposing these passages to have been added
some time after. We may therefore offer the conjecture, that
the first Satire was written shortly after the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 100,
as a preface or introduction to the book, and that a few additions
were made to it, even so late as thirty years subsequently.</p>

<p>The second Satire was, in all probability, the first written.
The allusion in the first line to the Sarmatæ, may perhaps be
connected with the Sarmatian war, which took place <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 93,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
and in which Domitian engaged in person. And this date
will correspond with the other references in the Satire by
which an approximation to the time of its composition may be
obtained. In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 84 Domitian received the censorship for
life (l. 121), at the same time that he was carrying on an
incestuous intercourse with his own niece Julia. This connection
was continued for some years. Shortly after the death
of Julia, the Vestal virgin Cornelia was buried alive, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 91.
These are alluded to as <em>recent</em> events (l. 29, "nuper"). Agricola,
too, the conqueror of Britain, died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 93 (cf. l. 160),
whose campaigns are spoken of as recent occurrences, "modo
captas Orcadas." The mention of Gracchus also connects this
with the eighth Satire, part of which at least was probably
written soon after the consulship of Lateranus in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 94.
We may therefore conjecture that the Satire was composed
between the years <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 93 and 95.</p>

<p>The third Satire may perhaps have been written in the
reign of Domitian, and may refer to the general departure of
men of worth from Rome, when Domitian expelled the philosophers,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 90. Umbritius, who predicted the murder of
Galba, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 69, might have been alive at that time; and, from
his political views, would have been a friend of Juvenal, who
was a bitter enemy of Otho. The nightly deeds of violence
perpetrated by Nero would have been still fresh in men's
memories (l. 278, <em>seq.</em>; cf. Pers., Sat., iv., 49); as would the judicial
murder of Barea Soranus, and the arrogance of Fabricius
Veiento (l. 116, 185). Still there are other parts of the
Satire that seem to bear evidence of a later date. The name
of Isæus would hardly have been so familiar in Rome till ten
years after this date, l. 74. It was not till <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 107 that
Trajan undertook the draining of the Pontine marshes; to
which there is most probably an allusion in l. 32 and 307; to
which nothing of importance had been done since the days of
Augustus. The great influx of foreigners into Rome, in the
train of Hadrian, at a still later date, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 118, probably gave
rise to the spirited episode from l. 58-125. (See Chronology.)
We may therefore consider it probable that the main body of
the Satire was written toward the close of the reign of Domitian,
and received additions in the commencement of the
reign of Hadrian.</p>

<p>The fourth Satire in all probability describes a real event;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
and would have possessed but little interest after any great
lapse of time, subsequent to the fact described. We may
therefore fairly assign it to the early part of Nerva's reign,
very shortly after the death of Domitian, which is mentioned
at the close of the Satire.</p>

<p>The fifth Satire contains nothing by which we can determine
the date. From Juvenal's hatred of Domitian, we may
suppose that l. 36 was suggested by the condemnation of
Senecio, who was put to death for writing a panegyric on
Helvidius Priscus, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 90. If the Aurelia (l. 98) be the
lady mentioned by Pliny (Epist., ii., 20), this would strengthen
the conjecture, as Pliny's second book of Epistles was
probably written very shortly before that date.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that considerable portions of the sixth
Satire were written in the reign of Trajan. 1. The lines
407-411 describe exactly the events which took place at Antioch,
in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 115, when Trajan was entering on his Armenian
and Parthian campaigns. 2. The coins of Trajan of the year
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 110, have the legend Dacicus and Germanicus, cf. l. 205;
and although Domitian triumphed over the Dacians and Germans,
none of his extant coins bear that inscription; the general
title being Augustus Germanicus simply. 3. Again, l.
502 describes a kind of headdress, very common on the coins
of the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian, representing Plotina
the wife of Trajan, Marciana his sister, and Sabina the wife of
Hadrian, and others: and this fashion was a very short-lived
one. Beginning with the court, it probably soon descended to
the ladies of inferior rank; but like its unnatural antitype,
the towering, powdered, and plastered rolls of our own countrywomen,
in the degraded days of the two first Georges, it was
too unnatural and disfiguring to remain long in vogue with
that sex, to whom "tanta est quærendi cura decoris tanquam
famæ discrimen agatur aut animæ." 4. The subject itself also
affords an additional reason for supposing that the Satire was
composed when the poet was advanced in life. The vices of
women are hardly a topic for a young writer to select; but
the vigorous manner in which he handles the lash, rather marks
the state of mind of the man who has outgrown the passions of
early manhood, and from "the high heaven of his philosophy"
looks down with cold austerity on the desires, and with bitter
indignation at the vices, of those whose feelings he has long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
since ceased to share. Juvenal was, as Hodgson says, "an
impenetrable bachelor," and if, as he conjectures, he was jilted
in his early youth, this fact would give additional bitterness
to the rancor which in old age he would feel toward the sex
by whom his personal happiness had been embittered, as well
as the ruin of his native country precipitated. 5. If we are
right in supposing that by Heliodorus, Juvenal meant Artemidorus
Capito (and the change in the name is both simple and
readily suggested), this would also bring down the date of this
Satire to Juvenal's later years, as about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 122 was the
time when this court-physician of Hadrian had attained his
greatest reputation. 6. In line 320, Saufeia is spoken of in
similar terms to those employed in the eleventh Satire, which
was confessedly the work of his later years. 7. Compare also
the mention of Archigenes (l. 236) with the 98th line of the
thirteenth Satire, written <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 118. 8. The allusions to the
importation of foreigners, with their exotic vices, would also
refer to the same date. See Chron., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 118.</p>

<p>The date of the seventh Satire will depend mainly on the
question, Whom does Juvenal intend to panegyrize in his 1st
line?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et spes et ratio studiorum in Cæsare tantum."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gifford pronounces unhesitatingly in favor of Domitian, and
his argument is very plausible. "The Satire," he says, "would
appear to have been written in the early part of Domitian's
reign; and Juvenal, by giving the emperor '<em>one honest line</em>'
of praise, probably meant to stimulate him to extend his patronage.
He did not think very ill of him at the time, and
augured happily for the future." Juvenal's subsequent hatred
of Domitian was caused, he thinks, by his bitter mortification
at finding, in a few years, this "sole patron of literature"
changed into a ferocious and bloody persecutor of all the arts.
This opinion he supports by some references to contemporary
writers, and by the evidence of coins of Domitian existing
with a head of Pallas on the reverse, to symbolize his royal
patronage of poetry and literary pursuits. But in almost every
instance Gifford errs in assigning too early a date to the
Satires; and one or two points in this clearly show that we
must bring it down to a much later period. Domitian succeeded
to the throne <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 81, and it could only have been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
the <em>earlier</em> years of his reign that even his most servile flatterers
could have complimented him upon his patronage of
learning. Now, 1. It was not till about ten years after this
that the actor Paris acquired his influence and his wealth;
and even allowing the very problematical story of the banishment
of Juvenal having been caused by the offense given to
the favorite by the famous lines (85-92) to be true, this
would bring it down to a time subsequent to the banishment
of philosophers from Rome; after which act Juvenal, certainly,
would not have written the first line on Domitian. 2.
Again, in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 90, Quintilian was teaching in a public school
at Rome, and receiving a salary from the imperial treasury;
it could hardly therefore be so early as this date that he had
acquired the fortune and estates alluded to in l. 189. 3. In
l. 82, the Thebaid of Statius is mentioned. This poem was
finished <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 94; and though it is true that Statius might,
most probably, have publicly recited portions of it <em>during its
progress</em>, it would have hardly earned the great reputation
implied in Juvenal's lines, at a sufficiently early date to allow
us to assign it to the first two or three years of Domitian's
reign.</p>

<p>I should, therefore, rather suppose that by Cæsar we are to
understand Nerva. The praise of Domitian is incompatible
with Juvenal's universal hatred and execration of him. The
opening of the reign of the mild and excellent Nerva might
well inspire hopes of the revival of a taste for literature and
the arts; and I would conjecture the close of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 96 as the
date of the Satire. Before the end of the year Statius was
dead; but Juvenal's words seem to imply that he was still
living. Again, Matho the lawyer has failed, and is in great
poverty (l. 129), to which Martial alludes in lib. xi., Ep., part
of which book was evidently written shortly before <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 97.
But if we are right in supposing the first Satire to have been
written about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 100, the intervening years will have given
Matho ample time to retrieve his fortune by his infamous
trade of informing, and reappear as the luxurious character
described Sat., i., 32.</p>

<p>Of the eighth Satire, if "Lateranus" be the true reading
(l. 147), or if he be intended by "Damasippus," as I believe,
we may assume the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 101 or 102 as the probable
date: Lateranus had been consul <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 94, and in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 101 Trajan for the first time extended the arms of Rome
beyond the Danube. Cf. l. 169.</p>

<p>The plunder of his province of Africa, by Marius Priscus,
was a recent event (l. 120 "nuper"); but, as we have said
above, he was impeached by Pliny and Tacitus in the year
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 100. Ponticus, to whom the Satire is addressed, may
be the person to whom Martial refers in his twelfth book,
which was written <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 104.</p>

<p>There are two allusions by which we may form a conjecture
as to the date of the ninth Satire. Crepereius Pollio is mentioned
as nearly in the same circumstances of profligate poverty
(l. 6, 7) as is described in the eleventh Satire (l. 43),
which was undoubtedly written in Juvenal's later years; and
he alludes (l. 117) to Saufeia, in very much the same terms in
which he speaks of her in the sixth Satire (l. 320), which we
suppose to have been written in his old age.</p>

<p>The internal evidence, supplied by the sustained majesty
and dignified flow of language of the tenth (as well as of the
fourteenth) Satire, without taking into consideration the philosophical
nature of the subject of both, is quite sufficient to
prove that they must have been the finished productions of a
late period of a thoughtful life. We are therefore quite prepared
to admit the conjecture that the allusion in line 136 is
to the column of Trajan, erected in the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 113. The
repetition of the line (226) also connects this with the first
Satire, which it probably preceded only by a short interval.</p>

<p>The 203d line of the eleventh Satire fixes its date to the
later years of Juvenal's life. It breathes, besides, throughout
the spirit of a calm and philosophic enjoyment of the blessings
of life, that tells of declining age; cheered by a chastened appreciation
of the comforts by which it is surrounded, but far
removed from all extraneous or meretricious excitement, and
utterly abhorrent of all noisy or exuberant hilarity. An additional
argument is mentioned in the Chronology for referring
it to the date <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 124.</p>

<p>The twelfth Satire contains nothing by which we can fix
its date with any certainty. If, however, as the commentators
suppose, the wife of Fuscus, in the 45th line, be Saufeia, it
will be connected with the sixth, ninth, and eleventh Satires,
and may probably be considered the work of his advanced
age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span></p>

<p>The thirteenth Satire is fixed by line 17 to the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
118, the 60th after the consulship of L. Fonteius Capito.
This is the only Satire to which Mr. Clinton has assigned a
date.</p>

<p>The argument applied to the tenth Satire will apply with
nearly equal force to the fourteenth. We are therefore prepared
to admit the plausibility of the conjecture, that l.     <span class="linenum">196</span>
refers to the progress of Hadrian through Britain, which
would fix the date to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 120; a very short time previous to
the composition of the following Satire.</p>

<p>The event recorded in the fifteenth Satire occurred shortly
after the consulship of Junius, l. 27, "nuper consule Junio
gesta." This was, in all probability, Junius Rusticus, who
was consul with Hadrian <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 119. The 110th line also
probably refers to the influx of Greeks and other foreigners
into Rome, in the train of Hadrian (to which we have alluded
in discussing the date of the third Satire), which took place in
the preceding year.</p>

<p>The sixteenth Satire may have either been the draft of
a longer poem, commenced in early life (as l. 3 <em>may</em> imply),
which the poet never cared to finish; or an outline for a more
perfect composition, which he never lived to elaborate. The
mention of Fucus may connect it with the twelfth Satire.
But though there is quite enough remaining to warrant us in
unhesitatingly ascribing the authorship to Juvenal, there is
too little left to enable us to form even a probable conjecture
as to the date of its composition.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add, that, after a careful examination
of the foregoing Chronology, it must be evident to every
novice in scholarship, that the whole life of Juvenal, as usually
given, is a mere myth, to which one can not even apply, as in
many legendary biographies, the epithet of poetical.</p>

<h2>ARGUMENTS
OF THE
SATIRES OF JUVENAL.</h2>


<h3>SATIRE I.</h3>

<p>This Satire seems, from several incidental circumstances to have been
produced subsequently to most of them; and was probably drawn up
after the author had determined to collect and publish his works, as a
kind of Introduction.</p>

<p>He abruptly breaks silence with an impassioned complaint of the importunity
of bad writers, and a resolution of retaliating upon them; and
after ridiculing their frivolous taste in the choice of their subjects, declares
his own intention to devote himself to Satire. After exposing the
corruption of men, the profligacy of women, the luxury of courtiers, the
baseness of informers and fortune-hunters, the treachery of guardians,
and the peculation of officers of state, he censures the general passion
for gambling, the servile rapacity of the patricians, the avarice and gluttony
of the rich, and the miserable poverty and subjection of their dependents;
and after some bitter reflections on the danger of satirizing
living villainy, concludes with a resolution to attack it under the mask
of departed names.</p>


<h3>SATIRE II.</h3>

<p>This Satire contains an animated attack upon the hypocrisy of the
philosophers and reformers of the day, whose ignorance, profligacy, and
impiety it exposes with just severity.</p>

<p>Domitian is here the object; his vices are alluded to under every different
name; and it gives us a high opinion of the intrepid spirit of the
man who could venture to circulate, even in private, so faithful a representation
of that blood-thirsty tyrant.</p>


<h3>SATIRE III.</h3>

<p>Umbritius, an Aruspex and friend of the author, disgusted at the prevalence
of vice and the disregard of unassuming virtue, is on the point
of quitting Rome; and when a little way from the city stops short to acquaint
the poet, who has accompanied him, with the causes of his retirement.
These may be arranged under the following heads: That Flattery
and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome; in these, especially the
first, foreigners have a manifest superiority over the natives, and consequently
engross all favor&mdash;that the poor are universally exposed to scorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
and insult&mdash;that the general habits of extravagance render it difficult for
them to subsist&mdash;that the want of a well-regulated police subjects them
to numberless miseries and inconveniences, aggravated by the crowded
state of the capital, from all which a country life is happily free: on the
tranquillity and security of which he dilates with great beauty.</p>


<h3>SATIRE IV.</h3>

<p>In this Satire Juvenal indulges his honest spleen against Crispinus,
already noticed, and Domitian, the constant object of his scorn and abhorrence.
The introduction of the tyrant is excellent; the mock solemnity
with which the anecdote of the Turbot is introduced, the procession
of the affrighted counselors to the palace, and the ridiculous debate
which terminates in as ridiculous a decision, show a masterly hand.
The whole concludes with an indignant and high-spirited apostrophe.</p>


<h3>SATIRE V.</h3>

<p>Under pretense of advising one Trebius to abstain from the table of
Virro, a man of rank and fortune, Juvenal takes occasion to give a spirited
detail of the insults and mortifications to which the poor were subjected
by the rich, at those entertainments to which, on account of the
political connection subsisting between patrons and clients, it was sometimes
thought necessary to invite them.</p>


<h3>SATIRE VI.</h3>

<p>The whole of this Satire, not only the longest, but the most complete
of the author's works, is directed against the female sex. It may be
distributed under the following heads: Lust variously modified, imperiousness
of disposition, fickleness, gallantry, attachment to improper pursuits,
litigiousness, drunkenness, unnatural passions, fondness for singers,
dancers, etc.; gossiping, cruelty, ill manners; outrageous pretensions
to criticism, grammar, and philosophy; superstitious and unbounded
credulity in diviners and fortune-tellers; introducing supposititious
children; poisoning their step-sons to possess their fortunes; and, lastly,
murdering their husbands.</p>


<h3>SATIRE VII.</h3>

<p>This Satire contains an animated account of the general discouragement
under which literature labored at Rome. Beginning with poetry,
it proceeds through the various departments of history, law, oratory,
rhetoric, and grammar; interspersing many curious anecdotes, and enlivening
each different head with such satirical, humorous, and sentimental
remarks as naturally flow from the subject.</p>


<h3>SATIRE VIII.</h3>

<p>Juvenal demonstrates, in this Satire, that distinction is merely personal;
that though we may derive rank and titles from our ancestors,
yet if we degenerate from the virtues by which they obtained them, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
can not be considered truly noble. This is the main object of the Satire;
which, however, branches out into many collateral topics&mdash;the profligacy
of the young nobility; the miserable state of the provinces, which
they plundered and harassed without mercy; the contrast between the
state of debasement to which the descendants of the best families had
sunk, and the opposite virtues to be found in persons of the lowest station
and humblest descent.</p>


<h3>SATIRE IX.</h3>

<p>The Satire consists of a dialogue between the poet and one Nævolus,
a dependent of some wealthy debauchee, who, after making him subservient
to his unnatural passions, in return starved, insulted, hated, and
discarded him. The whole object seems to be, to inculcate the grand
moral lesson, that, under any circumstances, a life of sin is a life of
slavery.</p>


<h3>SATIRE X.</h3>

<p>The subject of this inimitable Satire is the vanity of human wishes.
From the principal events of the lives of the most illustrious characters
of all ages, the poet shows how little happiness is promoted by the attainment
of what our indistinct and limited views represent as the greatest
of earthly blessings. Of these he instances wealth, power, eloquence,
military glory, longevity, and personal accomplishments; all of which,
he shows, have proved dangerous or destructive to their respective possessors.
Hence he argues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations
of Heaven; and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he
points out with great force and beauty the objects for which a rational
being may presume to approach the Almighty.</p>


<h3>SATIRE XI.</h3>

<p>Under the form of an invitation to his friend Persicus, Juvenal takes
occasion to enunciate many admirable maxims for the due regulation
of life. After ridiculing the miserable state to which a profligate patrician
had reduced himself by his extravagance, he introduces the picture
of his own domestic economy, which he follows by a pleasing view
of the simplicity of ancient manners, artfully contrasted with the extravagance
and luxury of the current times. After describing with great
beauty the entertainment he proposes to give his friend, he concludes
with an earnest recommendation to him to enjoy the present with content,
and await the future with calmness and moderation.</p>


<h3>SATIRE XII.</h3>

<p>Catullus, a valued friend of the poet, had narrowly escaped shipwreck.
In a letter of rejoicing to their common friend, Corvinus, Juvenal describes
the danger that his friend had incurred, and his own hearty and
disinterested delight at his preservation, contrasting his own sacrifices of
thanksgiving at the event, with those offered by the designing legacy-hunters,
by which the rich and childless were attempted to be insnared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span></p>


<h3>SATIRE XIII.</h3>

<p>Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidential person,
who, when he came to re-demand it, forswore the deposit. The indignation
and fury expressed by Calvinus at this breach of trust, reached
the ears of his friend Juvenal, who endeavors to soothe and comfort him
under his loss. The different topics of consolation follow one another
naturally and forcibly, and the horrors of a troubled conscience were
perhaps never depicted with such impressive solemnity as in this Satire.</p>


<h3>SATIRE XIV.</h3>

<p>The whole of this Satire is directed to the one great end of self-improvement.
By showing the dreadful facility with which children copy
the vices of their parents, the poet points out the necessity as well as the
sacred duty of giving them examples of domestic purity and virtue.
After briefly enumerating the several vices, gluttony, cruelty, debauchery,
etc., which youth imperceptibly imbibe from their seniors, he enters
more at large into that of avarice; of which he shows the fatal and inevitable
consequences. Nothing can surpass the exquisiteness of this
division of the Satire, in which he traces the progress of that passion in
the youthful mind from the paltry tricks of saving a broken meal to the
daring violation of every principle, human and divine. Having placed
the absurdity as well as the danger of immoderate desires in every point
of view, he concludes with a solemn admonition to rest satisfied with
those comforts and conveniences which nature and wisdom require, and
which a decent competence is easily calculated to supply.</p>


<h3>SATIRE XV.</h3>

<p>After enumerating with great humor the animal and vegetable gods
of the Egyptians, the author directs his powerful ridicule at their sottish
and ferocious bigotry; of which he gives an atrocious and loathsome example.
The conclusion of the Satire, which is a just and beautiful description
of the origin of civil society (infinitely superior to any thing
that Lucretius or Horace has delivered on the subject), founded not on
natural instinct, but on principles of mutual benevolence implanted by
God in the breast of man, and of man alone, does honor to the genius,
good sense, and enlightened morality of the author.</p>


<h3>SATIRE XVI.</h3>

<p>Under a pretense of pointing out to his friend Gallus the advantages
of a military life, Juvenal attacks with considerable spirit the exclusive
privileges which the army had acquired or usurped, to the manifest injury
of the civil part of the community.</p>

<h2>JUVENAL'S SATIRES.</h2>


<h3>SATIRE I.</h3>

<p>Must I always be a hearer only? Shall I never retaliate,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
though plagued so often with the Theseid of Codrus,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> hoarse
<em>with reciting it</em>? Shall one man, then, recite<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> to me his
Comedies, and another his Elegies, with impunity? Shall
huge "Telephus" waste a whole day for me, or "Orestes,"
with the margin of the manuscript full to the very edge, and
written on the back too,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and yet not finished, <em>and I not retort</em>?</p>

<p>No one knows his own house better than I do the grove of
Mars, and Vulcan's cave close to the Æolian rocks. The
agency of the winds,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> what ghosts Æacus is torturing,
whence another bears off the gold<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of the stolen fleece, what
huge mountain-ashes Monychus hurls, <em>all this</em> the plane-groves
of Fronto,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and the statues shaken and the columns split by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>the eternal reciter, are for ever re-echoing. You may look
for the same themes from the greatest poet and the least.</p>

<p>And yet I too have shirked my hand away from the rod.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
I too have given advice to Sylla, that he should enjoy a sound
sleep by returning to a private station.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> When at every
turn you meet so many poetasters, it were a foolish clemency
to spare paper that is sure to be wasted. Yet why I rather
choose to trace my course over that plain through which the
great foster-son of Aurunca<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> urged his steeds, I will, if you
are at leisure, and with favorable ear listen to reason, tell
you. When a soft eunuch<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> marries a wife; when Mævia<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
transfixes the Tuscan boar, and, with breasts exposed, grasps
the hunting-spears; when one man singly vies in wealth with
the whole body of patricians, under whose razor my beard,
grown exuberant, sounded while I was in my prime;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> when
Crispinus, one of the dregs of the mob of the Nile, a born-slave
of Canopus, (while his shoulder hitches up his Tyrian
cloak,)<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> airs his summer ring from his sweating fingers, and
can not support the weight of his heavier gem;&mdash;it is difficult
not to write satire. For who can be so tolerant of this iniquitous
city, who so case-hardened,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as to contain himself!
When there comes up the bran-new litter of Matho<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the
lawyer, filled with himself; and after him, he that informed
upon his powerful friend; and will soon plunder the nobility,
already close-shorn, of the little that remains to them; one
whom even Massa fears, whom Carus soothes with a bribe;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>or a Thymele suborned by some trembling Latinus.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> When
fellows supplant you, who earn their legacies by night-work,
lifted up to heaven<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> by what is now the surest road to the
highest advancement, the lust of some ancient harridan.
Proculeius gets one poor twelfth; but Gillo has eleven
twelfths. Each gets the share proportioned to his powers.
Well! let him take the purchase-money of his blood, and be
as pale as one that has trodden on a snake with naked heel,
or a rhetorician about to declaim at the altar at Lyons.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Why need I tell with what indignation my parched liver
boils, when here, the plunderer of his ward (reduced by him
to the vilest gains) presses on the people with his crowds of
menials, and there, he that was condemned by a powerless
sentence. (For what cares he for infamy while he retains
the plunder?) Marius,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> though an exile, drinks from the
eighth hour, and laughs at the angry gods, while thou, O
Province, victorious in the suit, art in tears! Shall I not
deem these themes worthy of the lamp of Venusium?<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Shall
I not lash these? Why rather sing tales of Hercules or
Diomede, or the bellowing of the Labyrinth, and the sea
struck by the boy Icarus, and the winged artificer?<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> When
the pander inherits the wealth of the adulterer (since the wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>has lost the right of receiving it),<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> taught to gaze at the ceiling,
and snore over his cups with well-feigned sleep. When
he considers himself privileged to expect the command of a
cohort, who has squandered his money on his stables, and has
run through all his ancestors' estate, while he flies with rapid
wheel along the Flaminian road;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> for while yet a youth, like
Automedon, he held the reins, while the great man showed
himself off to his "mistress-in-his-cloak."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Do you not long
to fill your capacious tablets, even in the middle of the cross-ways,
when there comes borne on the shoulders of six slaves,
exposed to view on either side, with palanquin almost uncurtained,
and aping the luxurious Mæcenas, the forger, who
made himself a man of splendor and wealth by a few short
lines, and a moistened seal?<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Next comes the powerful
matron, who when her husband thirsts, mingles the toad's-poison
in the mellow wine of Cales which she is herself about
to hand him, and with skill superior even to Locusta,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> initiates
her neighbors, too simple before, in the art of burying
their husbands, livid from the poison, in despite of infamy and
the public gaze.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Dare some deed to merit scanty Gyarus<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and the jail, if
you wish to be somebody. Honesty is commended, and
starves. It is to their crimes they are indebted for their
gardens, their palaces, their tables, their fine old plate, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>the goat standing in high relief from the cup. Whom does
the seducer of his own daughter-in-law, greedy for gold, suffer
to sleep? Or the unnatural brides, or the adulterer not out of
his teens?<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> If nature denies the power, indignation would
give birth to verses, such as it could produce, like mine and
Cluvienus'.</p>

<p>From the time that Deucalion ascended the mountain in his
boat, while the storm upheaved the sea,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and consulted the
oracle, and the softening stones by degrees grew warm with
life, and Pyrrha displayed to the males the virgins unrobed;
all that men are engaged in, their wishes, fears, anger, pleasures,
joys, and varied pursuits, form the hotch-potch of my
book.</p>

<p>And when was the crop of vices more abundant? When
were the sails of avarice more widely spread? When had
gambling its present spirits? For now men go to the hazard
of the gaming-table not simply with their purses, but play
with their whole chest<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> staked. What fierce battles will you
see there, while the steward supplies the weapons for the contest!
Is it then mere common madness to lose a hundred
sestertia, and not leave enough for a tunic for your shivering
slave!<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Which of our grandsires erected so many villas?
Which of them ever dined by himself<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> on seven courses? In
our days the diminished sportula is set outside the threshold,
ready to be seized upon by the toga-clad crowd.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Yet he
(that dispenses it), before giving, scans your features, and
dreads lest you should come with counterfeit pretense and
under a false name. When recognized you will receive your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>dole. He bids the crier summon the very Trojugenæ themselves.
For even they assail the door with us. "Give the
prætor his! Then to the tribune." But the freedman must
first be served! "I was before him!" he says. "Why
should I fear or hesitate to stand up for my turn, though I
was born on the banks of Euphrates, which the soft windows<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
in my ears would attest, though I myself were to deny the
fact. But my five shops bring me in four hundred sestertia.
What does the Laticlave<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> bestow that's worth a wish, since
Corvinus keeps sheep for hire in the Laurentine fields? I own
more than Pallas<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and the Licini. Let the tribunes wait then!"
Let Riches carry the day, and let not him give place even to
the sacrosanct magistrate, who came but the other day to this
city with chalked feet.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Since with us the most revered
majesty is that of riches; even though as yet, pernicious
money, thou dwellest in no temple, nor have we as yet reared
altars to coin, as we worship Peace and Faith, Victory and
Virtue, and Concord, whose temple resounds with the noise
of storks returning to their nests.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But when a magistrate
of the highest rank reckons up at the end of the year, what
the sportula brings him in, how much it adds to his revenue,
what shall the poor retainers do, who look to this for their
toga, for their shoes, their bread and fire at home? A closely-wedged
crowd of litters is clamorous for the hundred quadrantes,
and his wife, though sick or pregnant, accompanies
and goes the rounds with her husband. One practicing a
crafty trick now worn threadbare, asks for his wife though
really absent, displaying in her stead an empty and closed
palanquin: "My Galla is inside," he says, "dispatch us with
all speed. Why hesitate?" "Put out your head, Galla!"
"O don't disturb her! she's asleep!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The day is portioned out with a fine routine of engagements.
First the sportula; then the Forum,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and Apollo<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
learned in the law; and the triumphal statues, among

up his titles, whose image, as though sacred, one dare not venture
to defile.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> At length, the old and wearied-out clients
quit the vestibule and give up all their hopes;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> although
their expectation of a dinner has been full-long protracted:
the poor wretches must buy their cabbage and fire. Meanwhile
their patron-lord will devour the best that the forest
and ocean can supply, and will recline in solitary state with
none but himself on his couches. For out of so many fair,
and broad, and such ancient dishes, they gorge whole patrimonies
at a single course. In our days there will not be
even a parasite! Yet who could tolerate such sordid luxury!
How gross must that appetite be, which sets before itself
whole boars, an animal created to feast a whole company!
Yet thy punishment is hard at hand, when distended with
food thou layest aside thy garments, and bearest to the bath
the peacock undigested! Hence sudden death, and old age
without a will. The news<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> travels to all the dinner-tables,
but calls forth no grief, and thy funeral procession advances,
exulted over by disgusted friends!<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> There is nothing farther
that future times can add to our immorality. Our posterity
must have the same desires, perpetrate the same acts. Every
vice has reached its climax. Then set sail! spread all your
canvas! Yet here perchance you may object, whence can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>talent be elicited able to cope with the subject? Whence that
blunt freedom of our ancestors, whose very name I dare not
utter, of writing whatever was dictated by their kindling
soul. What matter, whether Mucius forgive the libel, or
not? But take Tigellinus for your theme, and you will shine
in that tunic, in which they blaze standing,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who smoke with
throat transfixed, and you will draw a broad furrow in the
middle of the sand. "Must he then, who has given<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> aconite to
his three uncles, be borne on down cushions, suspended aloft,
and from thence look down on us?" Yes! when he meets you
press your finger to your lip! There will be some informer
standing by to whisper in his ear, That's he! Without fear
for the consequences you may match<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Æneas and the fierce
Rutulian. The death of Achilles breeds ill-will in no one; or
the tale of the long-sought Hylas, who followed his pitcher.
But whensoever Lucilius, fired with rage, has brandished as
it were his drawn sword, his hearer, whose conscience chills
with the remembrance of crime, grows red. His heart sweats
with the pressure of guilt concealed. Then bursts forth rage
and tears! Ponder well, therefore, these things in your mind,
before you sound the signal blast. The soldier when helmeted
repents too late of the fight. I will try then what I may
be allowed to vent on those whose ashes are covered by the
Flaminian<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> or Latin road.</p>

<h3>SATIRE II.</h3>

<p>I long to escape from hence beyond the Sarmatians, and
the frozen sea, whenever those fellows who pretend to be
Curii and live like Bacchanals presume to read a lecture on
morality. First of all, they are utterly unlearned, though
you may find all their quarters full of busts of Chrysippus.
For the most finished scholar among them is he that has
bought an image of Aristotle or Pittacus, or bids his shelves
retain originals of Cleanthes. There is no trusting to the
outside! For what street is there that does not overflow with
debauchees of demure exterior? Dost thou reprove abominations,
that art thyself the most notorious sink among catamites
who pretend to follow Socrates? Thy rough limbs indeed,
and the stiff bristles on thy arms, seem to promise a vigorous
mind within; but on thy smooth behind, the surgeon with a
smile lances the swelling piles. These fellows affect a paucity
of words, and a wonderful taciturnity, and the fashion of
cutting their hair shorter than their eyebrows. There is
therefore more frankness and sincerity in Peribomius; the
man that by his very look and gait makes no secret of his depravity,
I look upon as the victim of destiny. The plain-dealing
of the latter class excites our pity; their very madness
pleads for our forgiveness. Far worse are they who in
Hercules' vein practice similar atrocities, and preaching up
virtue, perpetrate the foulest vice. "Shall I feel any dread for
thee, Sextus, unnatural thyself?" says the infamous Varillus.
"How am I worse than thou? Let the straight-limbed,
if you please, mock the bandy-legged; the fair European
sneer at the Ethiop. But who could tolerate the Gracchi if
they railed at sedition? Who would not confound heaven with
earth, and sea with sky,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> if a thief were odious to Verres, or a
murderer to Milo? If Clodius were to impeach adulterers, or
Catiline Cethegus? If Sylla's three pupils were to declaim
against Sylla's proscriptions? Such was the case of the
adulterer recently<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> defiled by incest, such as might be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>in Greek tragedy, who then set himself to revive those bitter
laws which all might tremble at, ay, even Venus and Mars,
at the same time that Julia was relieving her fruitful womb
by so many abortives,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and gave birth to shapeless masses, the
image of her uncle! Might not then, with all reason and
justice, even the very worst of vices look with contempt on
these counterfeit Scauri, and if censured turn and bite
again?"</p>

<p>Lauronia could not endure some fierce reformer of this class
so often exclaiming, "Where is now the Julian law? is it
slumbering?" and thus silenced him with a sneer: "Blest
days indeed! that set thee up as a censor of morals! Rome
now must needs retrieve her honor! A third Cato has
dropped from the clouds. But tell me, pray, where do you
buy these perfumes that exhale from your neck, all hairy
though it be! Do not be ashamed to tell the shopman's name.
But if old laws and statutes are to be raked up,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> before all
others the Scatinian ought to be revived. First scrutinize
and look into the conduct of the men. They commit the
greater atrocities; but it is their number protects them, and
their phalanxes close serried with their shields. There is a
wonderful unanimity among these effeminates. You will not
find one single instance of such execrable conduct in our
sex.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Tædia does not caress Cluvia, nor Flora Catulla.
Hispo acts both sex's parts, and is pale with two-handed lust.
Do <em>we</em> ever plead causes? Do we study civil law? or disturb
your courts with any clamor of our tongues? A few of
us perhaps may wrestle, or diet themselves on the trainer's
food; but only a few. You men, you spin wool, and carry
home in women's baskets your finished tasks. You men twist
the spindle big with its fine-drawn thread more deftly than
Penelope, more nimbly than Arachne; work, such as the dirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>drab does that sits crouching on her log. Every one knows
why Hister at his death made his freedman his sole heir,
while, when alive, he gave his maiden wife<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> so many presents.
She will be rich without a doubt, who will submit to lie
third in the wide bed. Get married then, and hold your
tongue, and earrings<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> will be the guerdon of your silence!
And after all this, forsooth, a heavy sentence is to be passed
on us women! Censure acquits the raven, but falls foul of
the dove!"</p>

<p>From this rebuke so true and undeniable, the counterfeit
Stoics recoiled in confusion, For what grain of untruth was
there in Lauronia's words? Yet, what will not others do,
when thou, Creticus, adoptest muslin robes, and to the amazement
of the people, inveighest in such a dress against Procula
or Pollinea?</p>

<p>Fabulla, thou sayest, is an adulteress. Then let her be
condemned, if you will have it so, and Carfinia also. Yet
though condemned, she would not put on such a dress as that.
"But it is July, it is raging hot, I am on fire!" Then plead
stark naked!<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> To be thought mad would be a less disgrace!
Is that a dress to propound laws and statutes in, in the ears
of the people when flushed with victory, with their wounds
yet green, or that noble race, fresh from their plows? What
an outcry would you make, if you saw such a dress on the
person of a Judex! I ask, would such a robe be suitable
even in a witness? Creticus! the implacable, the indomitable,
the champion of liberty, is transparent! Contagion has
caused this plague-spot, and will extend it to many more, just
as a whole flock perishes, in the fields from the scab of one
sheep, or pigs from mange, and the grape contracts the taint
from the grape it comes in contact with. Ere long you will
venture on something more disgraceful even than this dress.
No one ever reached the climax of vice at one step. You
will by degrees enter the band of those who wear at home
long fillets round their brows, and cover their necks with
jewels, and propitiate Bona Dea with the belly of a young
sow and a huge bowl of wine; but by an inversion of the old
custom <em>women</em>, kept far aloof, dare not cross the threshold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
The altar of the goddess is accessible to males alone. "Withdraw,
profane females!" is the cry. No minstrel here may
make her cornet sound! Such were the orgies by the secret
torch-light which the Baptæ celebrated, who used to weary
out even the Athenian Cotytto.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> One with needle held oblique
adds length to his eyebrows touched with moistened
soot, and raising the lids paints his quivering eyes. Another
drains a Priapus-shaped glass, and confines his long thick
hair with a caul of gold thread, clothed in sky-blue checks, or
close-piled yellow stuffs; while his attendant also swears by
Juno, the patron deity of his master. Another holds a
mirror, the weapon wielded by the pathic Otho, "the spoil of
Auruncan Actor,"<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in which he surveyed himself when fully
armed, before he gave the signal to engage&mdash;a thing worthy to
be recorded in the latest annals and history of the day. A
mirror! fit baggage for a civil war! O yes, forsooth! to kill
old Galba shows the consummate general, to pamper one's
complexion is the consistent occupation of the first citizen of
Rome; to aspire to the empire as the prize on Bebriacum's<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
plains, and then spread over his face a poultice applied with
his fingers! Such an act as neither the quivered Semiramis
perpetrated in the Assyrian realms, or Cleopatra flying dejected
in her Actian galley. Among this crew there is
neither decency of language, nor respect for the proprieties of
the table. Here is the foul license that Cybele enjoins, the
lisping speech, the aged priest with hoary hair, like one possessed,
a prodigy of boundless appetite, open to hire. Yet
why do they delay? since long ago they ought after the
Phrygian custom to have removed with their knives the superfluous
flesh.</p>

<p>Gracchus<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> gave four hundred sestertia as his dowry, with
himself, to a bugler, or else one that blew the straight trumpet.
The marriage deeds were duly signed, the blessing invoked,
a great dinner provided, the he-bride lay in the bridegroom's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>arms. O nobles! is it a censor we need, or an aruspex?
You would without doubt be horrified, and deem it a prodigy
of portentous import, if a woman gave birth to a calf, or a
cow to a lamb. The same Gracchus puts on flounces, the
long robe and flame-colored<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> veil, who, when bearing the
sacred shields swinging with mysterious thong, sweated beneath
the Ancilia! Oh! father of our city! whence came
such heinous guilt to the shepherds of Latium? Whence, O
Gradivus, came this unnatural lust that has tainted thy race?
See! a man illustrious in birth and rank is made over to a
man! Dost thou neither shake thy helmet, nor smite the
earth with thy lance? Dost thou not even appeal to thy
father Jove? Begone then! and quit the acres of the Campus
once so severe, which thou ceasest to care for! "I have some
duty-work to perform to-morrow at break of day in the Quirinal
valley." "What is the occasion?" "Why ask? my
friend is going to be married; only a few are invited!" If
we only live to see it, these things will be done in the broad
light of day, and claim to be registered in the public acts.
Meanwhile, there is one grievous source of pain that clings to
these male-brides, that they are incapable of bearing, and retaining
their lords' affections by bringing them children. No!
better is it that nature in this case gives their minds no power
over their bodies! They must die barren! Vain, in their
case, is fat Lyde with her medicated box; vain the holding
out their hands to the nimble Luperci.</p>

<p>Yet even this prodigy of crime is surpassed by the trident
of Gracchus in his gladiator's tunic,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> when in full flight he
traverses the middle of the arena. Gracchus! more nobly
born than the Manlii, and Marcelli, and Catulus' and Paulus'
race, and the Fabii, and all the spectators in the front row.
Ay, even though you add to these the very man himself, at
whose expense he cast his net as Retiarius.</p>

<p>That there are departed spirits, and realms beneath the
earth&mdash;that Charon's pole exists, and the foul frogs in the
Stygian whirlpool&mdash;and that so many thousand souls cross its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>waters in a single bark, not even boys believe, save those as
yet too young to be charged for their bath.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But do thou believe
them true! What does Curius feel, and the two Scipios,
what Fabricius and the shades of Camillus, what the legion cut
off at Cremera, and the flower of Roman youth slaughtered at
Cannæ&mdash;so many martial spirits&mdash;what do they feel when
such a shade as this passes from us to them? They would
long to be cleansed from the pollution of the contact, could
any sulphur and pine-torches be supplied to them, or could
there be a bay-tree to sprinkle them with water.</p>

<p>To such a pitch of degradation are we come!<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> We have,
indeed, advanced our arms beyond Juverna's shore, and the
Orcades<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> recently subdued, and the Britons content with
night contracted to its briefest span. But those abominations
which are committed in the victorious people's city are unknown
to those barbarians whom we have conquered. "Yet
there <em>is</em> a story told of one, an Armenian Zalates, who, more
effeminate than the rest of his young countrymen, is reported
to have yielded to the tribune's lust." See the result of intercourse
with Rome! He came a hostage! Here they learn
to be <em>men</em>! For if a longer tarry in the city be granted to
these youths, they will never lack a lover. Their plaids, and
knives, and bits, and whips, will soon be discarded. Thus it
is the vices of our young nobles are aped even at Artaxata.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<h3>SATIRE III.</h3>

<p>Although troubled at the departure of my old friend, yet
I can not but commend his intention of fixing his abode at
Cumæ, now desolate, and giving the Sibyl one citizen at least.
It is the high road to Baiæ, and has a pleasant shore; a delightful
retreat. I prefer even Prochyta<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> to the Suburra.
For what have we ever looked on so wretched or so lonely,
that you would not deem it worse to be in constant dread of
fires, the perpetual falling-in of houses, and the thousand
dangers of the cruel city,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and poets spouting in the month of
August.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But while his whole household is being stowed in a
single wagon, my friend Umbritius halted at the ancient triumphal
arches<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and the moist Capena. Here, where Numa
used to make assignations with his nocturnal mistress, the grove
of the once-hallowed fountain and the temples are in our days
let out to Jews, whose whole furniture is a basket and bundle
of hay.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> For every single tree is bid to pay a rent to the
people, and the Camenæ having been ejected, the wood is
one mass of beggars. We descended into the valley of Egeria
and the grottoes, so altered from what nature made them.
How much more should we feel the influence of the presiding
genius of the spring,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> if turf inclosed the waters with its
margin of green, and no marble profaned the native tufo.
Here then Umbritius began:<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Since at Rome there is no place for honest pursuits, no
profit to be got by honest toil&mdash;my fortune is less to-day than
it was yesterday, and to-morrow must again make that little
less&mdash;we purpose emigrating to the spot where Dædalus put
off his wearied wings, while my gray hairs are still but few,
my old age green and erect; while something yet remains
for Lachesis to spin, and I can bear myself on my own legs,
without a staff to support my right hand. Let us leave our
native land. There let Arturius and Catulus live. Let
those continue in it who turn black to white; for whom it
is an easy matter to get contracts for building temples, clearing
rivers, constructing harbors,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> cleansing the sewers, the
furnishing a funeral,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and under the mistress-spear set up the
slave to sale."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>These fellows, who in former days were horn-blowers, and
constant attendants on the municipal amphitheatres, and whose
puffed cheeks were well known through all the towns, now
themselves exhibit gladiatorial shows, and when the thumbs
of the rabble are turned up, let any man be killed to court
the mob. Returned from thence, they farm the public jakes.</p>

<p>And why not every thing? Since these are the men whom
Fortune, whenever she is in a sportive mood, raises from the
dust to the highest pinnacle of greatness.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>What shall <em>I</em> do at Rome? I can not lie; if a book is bad,
I can not praise it and beg a copy. I know not the motions
of the stars. I neither will nor can promise a man to secure
his father's death. I never inspected the entrails of a toad.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Let others understand how to bear to a bride the messages
and presents of the adulterer; no one shall be a thief by my
co-operation; and therefore I go forth, a companion to no
man,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> as though I were crippled, and a trunk useless from its
right hand being disabled.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Who, now-a-days, is beloved except the confidant of crime,
and he whose raging mind<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> is boiling with things concealed,
and that must never be divulged? He that has made you
the partaker of an honest secret, thinks that he owes you
nothing, and nothing will he ever pay. He will be Verres'
dear friend, who can accuse Verres at any time he pleases.
Yet set not thou so high a price on all the sands of shady
Tagus,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and the gold rolled down to the sea, as to lose your
sleep, and to your sorrow take bribes that ought to be spurned,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
and be always dreaded by your powerful friend.</p>

<p>What class of men is now most welcome to our rich men,
and whom I would especially shun, I will soon tell you;
nor shall shame prevent me.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> It is that the city is become
Greek, Quirites, that I can not tolerate; and yet how small
the proportion even of the dregs of Greece! Syrian Orontes
has long since flowed into the Tiber, and brought with it its
language, morals, and the crooked harps with the flute-player,
and its national tambourines, and girls made to stand for hire
at the Circus. Go thither, ye who fancy a barbarian harlot

utterly for nothing, that my infancy inhaled the air of Aventine,
nourished on the Sabine berry? Why add that this
nation, most deeply versed in flattery, praises the conversation
of an ignorant, the face of a hideously ugly friend, and
compares some weak fellow's crane-like neck to the brawny
shoulders of Hercules, holding Antæus far from his mother
Earth: and is in raptures at the squeaking voice,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> not a whit
superior in sound to that of the cock as he bites the hen. We
may, it is true, praise the same things, if we choose. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><em>they</em> are believed. Can he be reckoned a better actor,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> when
he takes the part of Thais, or acts the wife in the play, or
Doris<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> without her robe. It is surely a woman in reality that
seems to speak, and not a man personifying one. You would
swear it was a woman, perfect in all respects. In their country,
neither Antiochus, nor Stratocles, or Demetrius and the
effeminate Hæmus, would call forth admiration. For there
every man's an actor. Do you smile? He is convulsed with
a laugh far more hearty. If he spies a tear in his friend's
eye, he bursts into a flood of weeping; though in reality he
feels no grief. If at the winter solstice you ask for a little
fire, he calls for his thick coat. If you say, I am hot! he
breaks into a sweat. Therefore we are not fairly matched;
he has the best of it, who can at any time, either by night or
day, assume a fictitious face; kiss his hands in ecstasy, quite
ready, to praise his patron's grossest acts; if the golden cup
has emitted a sound, when its bottom is inverted.</p>

<p>Besides, there is nothing that is held sacred by these fellows,
or that is safe from their lust. Neither the mistress of
the house, nor your virgin daughter, nor her suitor, unbearded
as yet, nor your son, heretofore chaste. If none of these
are to be found, he assails his friend's grandmother. They
aim at learning the secrets of the house, and from that knowledge
be feared.</p>

<p>And since we have begun to make mention of the Greeks,
pass on to their schools of philosophy, and hear the foul crime
of the more dignified cloak.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> It was a Stoic that killed

Gorgonean horse lighted. There is no room for any Roman
here, where some Protogenes, or Diphilus, or Erimanthus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>reigns supreme; who, with the common vice of his race,
never shares a friend, but engrosses him entirely to himself.
For when he has infused into his patron's too ready ear one
little drop of the venom of his nature and his country, I am
ejected from the door; all my long-protracted service goes
for naught. Nowhere is the loss of a client of less account.
Besides (not to flatter ourselves) what service can the <em>poor
man</em> render, what merit can <em>he</em> plead, even though he be
zealous enough to hasten in his toga<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> before break of day,
when the very <em>prætor</em> himself urges on his lictor, and bids

have been long awake, lest his colleague<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> be beforehand with
him in paying his respects to Albina and Modia. Here, by

legion receive;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> whereas you, when the face of a well-dressed
harlot takes your fancy, hesitate to hand Chione from her
exalted seat.</p>

<p>Produce me at Rome a witness of as blameless integrity as
the host of the Idæan deity;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> let Numa stand forth, or he
that rescued Minerva when in jeopardy from her temple all
in flames: the question first put would be as to his income, that
about his moral character would come last of all. "How
many slaves does he keep? How many acres of public land
does he occupy?<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> With how many and what expensive dishes
is his table spread?" In exact proportion to the sum of money
a man keeps in his chest, is the credit given to his oath.
Though you were to swear by all the altars of the Samothracian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>and our own gods, the poor man is believed to
despise the thunderbolts and the gods, even with the sanction
of the gods themselves. Why add that this same poor
man furnishes material and grounds for ridicule to all, if his
cloak is dirty and torn, if his toga is a little soiled, and one
shoe gapes with its upper leather burst; or if more than one
patch displays the coarse fresh darning thread, where a rent
has been sewn up. Poverty, bitter though it be, has no
sharper pang than this, that it makes men ridiculous. "Let
him retire, if he has any shame left, and quit the cushions of
the knights, that has not the income required by the law, and
let these seats be taken by"&mdash;the sons of pimps, in whatever
brothel born!<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Here let the son of the sleek crier applaud

obscurity whose noble qualities are cramped by narrow means

meal.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> A man is ashamed here to dine off pottery ware,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
which, were he suddenly transported to the Marsi and a Sabine
board, contented there with a coarse bowl of blue earthenware,
he would no longer deem discreditable. There is a

when the rustic infant on its mother's lap is terrified at the
wide mouth of the ghastly mask, <em>there</em> you will see all costumes
equal and alike, both orchestra and common people.
White tunics are quite sufficient as the robe of distinction for
the highest personages there, even the very ædiles. Here, in
Rome, the splendor of dress is carried beyond men's means;
here, something more than is enough, is taken occasionally
from another's chest. In this fault all participate. Here we
all live with a poverty that apes our betters. Why should I
detain you? Every thing at Rome is coupled with high price.
What have you to give, that you may occasionally pay your
respects to Cossus? that Veiento may give you a passing
glance, though without deigning to open his mouth? One
shaves the beard, another deposits the hair of a favorite; the
house is full of venal cakes.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Now learn this fact, and keep
it to work within your breast. We clients are forced to pay
tribute and increase the private income of these pampered

<p>Who dreads, or ever did dread, the falling of a house at
cool Præneste, or at Volsinii seated among the well-wooded
hills, or simple Gabii,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> or the heights of sloping Tibur. We,
in Rome, inhabit a city propped in great measure on a slender
shore.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> For so the steward props up the falling walls,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>nightly alarms. Already is Ucalegon shouting for water,
already is he removing his chattels: the third story in the
house you live in is already in a blaze. You are unconscious!
For if the alarm begin from the bottom of the stairs,
he will be the last to be burned whom a single tile protects
from the rain, where the tame pigeons lay their eggs. Codrus
had a bed too small for his Procula, six little jugs the
ornament of his sideboard, and a little can besides beneath it,
and a Chiron reclining under the same marble; and a chest
now grown old in the service contained his Greek books, and
opic<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> mice-gnawed poems of divine inspiration. Codrus possessed
nothing at all; who denies the fact? and yet all that
little nothing that he had, he lost. But the climax that
crowns his misery is the fact, that though he is stark naked
and begging for a few scraps, no one will lend a hand to help
him to bed and board. But, if the great mansion of Asturius
has fallen, the matrons appear in weeds,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the senators in
mourning robes, the prætor adjourns the courts. Then it is
we groan for the accidents of the city; then we loathe the
very name of fire. The fire is still raging, and already there
runs up to him one who offers to present him with marble,
and contribute toward the rebuilding. Another will present
him with naked statues of Parian marble,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> another with

Minerva; another, a whole bushel of silver. Persicus, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>most splendid of childless men, replaces all he has lost by
things more numerous and more valuable, and might with
reason be suspected of having himself set his own house on
fire.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>If you can tear yourself away from the games in the circus,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
you can buy a capital house at Sora, or Fabrateria, or Frusino,
for the price at which you are now hiring your dark hole for
one year. There you will have your little garden, a well so
shallow as to require no rope and bucket, whence with easy
draught you may water your sprouting plants. Live there, enamored
of the pitchfork, and the dresser of your trim garden,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
from which you could supply a feast to a hundred Pythagoreans.
It is something to be able in any spot, in any retreat whatever,
to have made one's self proprietor even of a single lizard.</p>

<p>Here full many a patient dies from want of sleep; but that
exhaustion is produced by the undigested food that loads the
fevered stomach. For what lodging-houses allow of sleep?
None but the very wealthy can sleep at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Hence is the
source of the disease. The passing of wagons in the narrow
curves of the streets, and the mutual revilings of the teamdrivers<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
brought to a stand-still, would banish sleep even from
Drusus and sea-calves.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>If duty calls him,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the rich man will be borne through the
yielding crowd, and pass rapidly over their heads on the
shoulders of his tall Liburnian, and, as he goes, will read or
write, or even sleep inside his litter,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> for his sedan with windows
closed entices sleep. And still he will arrive before us.
In front of us, as we hurry on, a tide of human beings stops
the way; the mass that follows behind presses on our loins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>in dense concourse; one man pokes me with his elbow, another
with a hard pole;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> one knocks a beam against my head,
another a ten-gallon cask. My legs are coated thick with
mud; then, anon, I am trampled upon by great heels all
round me, and the hob-nail of the soldier's caliga remains imprinted
on my toe.</p>

<p>Do you not see with what a smoke the sportula is frequented?
A hundred guests! and each followed by his portable
kitchen.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Even Corbulo<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> himself could scarcely carry
such a number of huge vessels, so many things piled upon his
head, which, without bending his neck, the wretched little
slave supports, and keeps fanning his fire as he runs along.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Tunics that have been patched together are torn asunder
again. Presently, as the tug approaches, the long fir-tree
quivers, other wagons are conveying pine-trees; they totter
from their height, and threaten ruin to the crowd. For if
that wain, that is transporting blocks of Ligustican stone, is
upset, and pours its mountain-load upon the masses below,
what is there left of their bodies? Who can find their limbs
or bones? Every single carcass of the mob is crushed to
minute atoms as impalpable as their souls. While, all this
while, the family at home, in happy ignorance of their master's
fate, are washing up the dishes, and blowing up the fire
with their mouths, and making a clatter with the well-oiled
strigils, and arranging the bathing towels with the full oilflask.
Such are the various occupations of the bustling
slaves. But the master himself is at this moment seated<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> on
the banks of Styx, and, being a novice, is horrified at the
grim ferry-man, and dares not hope for the boat to cross the
murky stream; nor has he, poor wretch, the obol in his
mouth to hand to Charon.</p>

<p>Now revert to other perils of the night distinct from these.
What a height it is from the lofty roofs, from which a potsherd
tumbles on your brains. How often cracked and chipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>earthenware falls from the windows! with what a weight
they dint and damage the flint pavement where they strike it!
You may well be accounted remiss and improvident against
unforeseen accident, if you go out to supper without having
made your will. It is clear that there are just so many chances
of death, as there are open windows where the inmates are
awake inside, as you pass by. Pray, therefore, and bear
about with you this miserable wish, that they may be contented
with throwing down only what the broad basins have
held. One that is drunk, and quarrelsome in his cups, if he
has chanced to give no one a beating, suffers the penalty by
loss of sleep; he passes such a night as Achilles bewailing
the loss, of his friend;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> lies now on his face, then again on his
back. Under other circumstances, he can not sleep. In some
persons, sleep is the result of quarrels; but though daring
from his years, and flushed with unmixed wine, he cautiously
avoids him whom a scarlet cloak, and a very long train of
attendants, with plenty of flambeaux and a bronzed candelabrum,
warns him to steer clear of. As for me, whose only
attendant home<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is the moon, or the glimmering light of a
rushlight, whose wick I husband and eke out&mdash;he utterly despises
me! Mark the prelude of this wretched fray, if fray
it can be called, where he does all the beating, and I am only
beaten.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> He stands right in front of you, and bids you stand!
Obey you must. For what can you do, when he that gives the
command is mad with drink, and at the same time stronger
than you. "Where do you come from?" he thunders out:
"With whose vinegar and beans are you blown out? What
cobbler has been feasting on chopped leek<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> or boiled sheep's
head with you? Don't you answer? Speak, or be kicked!
Say where do you hang out? In what Jew's begging-stand
shall I look for you?" Whether you attempt to say a word
or retire in silence, is all one; they beat you just the same,
and then, in a passion, force you to give bail to answer for
the assault. This is a poor man's liberty! When thrashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>he humbly begs, and pummeled with fisticuffs supplicates,
to be allowed to quit the spot with a few teeth left in his
head. Nor is this yet all that you have to fear, for there will
not be wanting one to rob you, when all the houses are shut
up, and all the fastenings of the shops chained, are fixed and
silent.</p>

<p>Sometimes too a footpad does your business with his knife,
whenever the Pontine marshes and the Gallinarian wood are
kept safe by an armed guard. Consequently they all flock
thence to Rome as to a great preserve.</p>

<p>What forge or anvil is not weighed down with chains?
The greatest amount of iron used is employed in forging
fetters; so that you may well fear that enough may not be
left for plowshares, and that mattocks and hoes may run
short. Well may you call our great-grandsires<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> happy, and
the ages blest in which they lived, which, under kings and
tribunes long ago, saw Rome contented with a single jail.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>To these I could subjoin other reasons for leaving Rome,
and more numerous than these; but my cattle summon me to
be moving, and the sun is getting low. I must go. For long
ago the muleteer gave me a hint by shaking his whip. Farewell
then, and forget me not! and whenever Rome shall restore

<h3>SATIRE IV.</h3>

<p>Once more behold Crispinus!<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and often shall I have to
call him on the stage. A monster! without one virtue to
redeem his vices&mdash;of feeble powers, save only in his lust. It
is only a widow's charms this adulterer scorns.</p>

<p>What matters it then in what large porticoes he wearies
out his steeds&mdash;through what vast shady groves his rides
extend<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>&mdash;how many acres close to the forum, or what palaces
he has bought? No bad man is ever happy. Least of all he
that has added incest to his adultery, and lately seduced the
filleted priestess,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> that with her life-blood still warm must descend
into the earth.</p>

<p>But now we have to deal with more venial acts. Yet if
any other man had committed the same, he would have come
under the sentence of our imperial censor.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> For what would
be infamous in men of worth, a Titius or Seius, was becoming
to Crispinus. What can you do when no crime can be so
foul and loathsome as the perpetrator himself? He gave six
sestertia for a mullet.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> A thousand sesterces, forsooth! for
every pound of weight, as they allege, who exaggerate stories
already beyond belief. I should commend the act as a master-stroke
of policy, if by so noble a present he had got himself
named chief heir<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> in the will of some childless old man. A
better plea still would be that he had sent it to some mistress
of rank, that rides in her close chair with its wide glasses.
Nothing of the sort! He bought it for himself! We see
many things which even Apicius<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> (mean and thrifty compared
with him) never was guilty of. Did you do this in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>days of yore, Crispinus, when girt about with your native
papyrus?<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> What! pay this price for fish-scales? Perchance
you might have bought the fisherman cheaper than the fish!
You might have bought a whole estate for the money in some
of our provinces. In Apulia, a still larger one.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> What kind
of luxuries, then, may we suppose were gorged by the emperor
himself, when so many sestertia, that furnished forth
but a small portion, a mere side-dish of a very ordinary dinner,
were devoured by this court buffoon, now clothed in purple.
Chief of the equestrian order now is he who was wont
to hawk about the streets shads from the same borough<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> with
himself.</p>

<p>Begin, Calliope! here may we take our seats! This is no
poetic fiction; we are dealing with <em>facts</em>! Relate it, Pierian
maids! and grant me grace for having called you <em>maids</em>.</p>

<p>When the last of the Flavii was mangling the world, lying
at its last gasp, and Rome was enslaved by a Nero,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> ay, and
a <em>bald</em> one too, an Adriatic turbot of wonderful size fell into
the net, and filled its ample folds, off the temple of Venus
which Doric Ancona<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> sustains. No less in bulk was it than
those which the ice of the Mæotis incloses, and when melted
at length by the sun's rays, discharges at the outlets of the
sluggish Euxine, unwieldly from their long sloth, and fattened
by the long-protracted cold.</p>

<p>This prodigy of a fish the owner of the boat and nets designs
for the chief pontiff. For who would dare to put up such
a fish to sale, or to buy it? Since the shores too would be
crowded with informers; these inspectors of sea-weed, prowling
in every nook, would straightway contest the point<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> with
the naked fisherman, and would not scruple to allege that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>fish was a "stray," and that having made its escape from the
emperor's ponds, where it had long reveled in plenty, ought
of course to revert to its ancient lord. If we place any faith
in Palfurius or Armillatus, whatever is pre-eminently fine in
the whole sea, is the property of the exchequer, wherever it
swims. So, that it may not be utterly lost, it will be made a
present of, though now sickly autumn was giving place to
winter, and sick men were already expecting<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> their fits of
ague, though the rude tempest whistled and kept the fish
fresh, yet the fisherman hurries on as though a mild south
wind were blowing. And when the lakes were near at hand,
where, though in ruins, Alba<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> still preserves the Trojan fire,
and her Lesser Vesta,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> the wondering crowd for a short space
impeded his entrance; as they made way for him, the folding-doors
flew open on ready-turning hinge. The senators, shut
out themselves, watch the dainty admitted. He stands in the
royal presence. Then he of Picenum begins, "Deign to accept
what is too great for any private kitchen: let this day be
celebrated as the festival of your genius, haste to relieve your
stomach of its burden, and devour a turbot reserved to honor
your reign.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It insisted on being caught." What could be
more fulsome? and yet the great man's crest rose. What
flattery is there that it is not prepared to believe, when power
is praised as equal to the gods. But there was no dish of
sufficient size for the fish. Therefore the senators are summoned
to a council&mdash;men whom he hated! men on whose
faces sat the paleness engendered by the wretched friendship
with the great! At the loud summons of the Liburnian slave,
"Run! the emperor is already seated!" the first to snatch up
his cloak and hurry to the place was Pegasus, lately set as
bailiff over the amazed city;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> for what else were the præfects
of Rome in those days? of whom he was the best and most conscientious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>dispenser of the laws, though in those days of terror
he thought all things ought to be administered by justice unarmed.
Crispus<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> came too, that facetious old man, with high
character equal to his eloquence and mild disposition. Who
could have been a more serviceable minister to one that ruled
seas, and lands, and peoples, if, under that bane and pest of
mankind, he had been allowed to reprobate his savage nature
and give honest advice? But what is more ticklish than a
tyrant's ear, with whom the life even of a favorite was at
stake, though he might be talking of showers or heat, or a
rainy spring? He, therefore, never attempted to swim against
the stream, nor was he a citizen who dared give vent to the
free sentiments of his soul, and devote his life to the cause of
truth: and so it was that he saw many winters and eighty
summers; safe, by such weapons, even in a court like that.
Next to him hurried Acilius, a man of the same time of life;
with a youth<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> that ill deserved so cruel a death as that which
awaited him, so prematurely inflicted by the tyrant's swords;
but nobility coupled with old age, has long since been a
miracle. Consequently, for myself, I should prefer being a
younger brother of the giants.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> It was of no avail therefore
to the wretched man, that as a naked huntsman in the amphitheatre
of Alba, he fought hand to hand with Numidian
bears. For who, in our days, is not up to the artifices of the
patricians? Who would now admire that primitive cunning
of thine, Brutus? It is an easy thing to impose on a king that
wears a beard!<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. Then came Rubrius not a whit less pale,
though he was no noble, one accused of an ancient and nameless
crime, and yet more lost to shame than the pathic satirist.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
There too is to be seen Montanus' paunch, unwieldy
from its size, and Crispus reeking with unguent though so early
in the day, more than enough to furnish forth two funerals;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>and Pompeius, still more ruthless even than he at cutting
men's throats by his insinuating whisper; and he that kept
his entrails only to fatten the Dacian vultures, Fuscus, that
studied the art of war in his marble palace; and the shrewd
Veiento with the deadly Catullus,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> who raged with lust for a
girl he could not see, a monster and prodigy of guilt even in
our days, the blind flatterer, a common bridge-beggar<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> invested
with this hateful power, whose worthiest fate would be to run
begging by the carriages on the road to Aricia, and blow his
fawning kisses to the chariot as it descends the hill. No one
showed more astonishment at the turbot, for he was profuse
in his wonder, turning toward the left, but unfortunately the
fish lay on the other side. This was just the way he used to
praise the combat and fencing of the Cilician gladiator, and
the stage machinery, and the boys caught up by it to the
awning. Veiento is not to be outdone by him; but, like one
inspired by the maddening influence of Bellona, begins to divine.
"A mighty omen this you have received of some great
and noble triumph. Some captive king you'll take, or Arviragus
will be hurled from his British car. For the monster is
a foreign one. Do you see the sharp fins bristling on his
back like spears?" In one point only Fabricius was at fault,
he could not tell the turbot's country or age. "What then is
your opinion? Is it to be cut up?" "Heaven forefend so
great dishonor to the noble fish!" says Montanus. "Let a
deep dish be provided, whose thin sides may inclose its huge
circumference. Some cunning Prometheus to act on this
sudden emergency is required. Quick with the clay and potter's
wheel! But henceforth, Cæsar, let potters always attend
your armies!" This opinion, worthy of the author, carried
the day. He was well versed in the old luxury of the imperial
court, and Nero's nights,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and a second appetite when the
stomach was fired with the Falernian.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> No one in my day
was a greater connoisseur in good eating; he could detect at
the first bite whether the oysters were natives from Circeii,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>or the Lucrine rocks, or whether they came from the Rutupian
beds, and told the shore an Echinus came from at the
first glance.</p>

<p>They rise; and the cabinet being dismissed, the great chief
bids the nobles depart whom he had dragged to the Alban
height, amazed and forced to hurry, as though he were about
to announce some tidings of the Catti and fierce Sicambri; as
though from diverse parts of the world some alarming express
had arrived on hurried wing. And would that he had devoted
to such trifles as these those days of horror and cruelty,
in which he removed from the city those glorious and illustrious
spirits, with none to punish or avenge the deed! But
he perished as soon as he began to be an object of alarm to
cobblers. This was what proved fatal to one that was reeking
with the blood of the Lamiæ!</p>

<h3>SATIRE V.</h3>

<p>If you are not yet ashamed of your course of life,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and your
feeling is still the same, that you consider living at another
man's table to be the chief good; if you can put up with such
things as not even Sarmentus or Galba, contemptible as he
was, would have submitted to even at the unequal<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> board of
Cæsar himself; I should be afraid to believe your evidence
though you were on oath. I know nothing more easily satisfied
than the cravings of nature. Yet even suppose this little
that is needed to be wanting, is there no quay vacant? is
there no where a bridge, and a piece of mat, somewhat less
than half, to beg upon? Is the loss of a supper so great a
matter? is your craving so fierce? when, in faith, it were
much more reputable<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> to shiver there, and munch mouldy
fragments of dog-biscuit. In the first place, bear in mind,
that when invited to dinner, you receive payment in full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>your long-standing account of service. The sole result of
your friendship with the great man is&mdash;a meal! This your
patron sets down to your account, and, rare though it be, still
takes it into the calculation. Therefore, if after the lapse of
two months he deigns to send for his long-neglected client,
only that the third place may not be unoccupied in one couch
of his triclinium<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>&mdash;"Let us sup together," he says; the very
summit of your wishes! What more can you desire? Trebius
has that for which he ought to break his rest, and hurry away
with latchet all untied, in his alarm lest the whole crowd at
his patron's levee shall have already gone their round of compliments,
when the stars are fading, or at the hour when the
chill wain of sluggish Bootes wheels slowly round.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>But what sort of a supper is it after all? Wine, such as
wool just shorn would not imbibe.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> You will see the guests
become frantic as the priests of Cybele. Wranglings are the
prelude of the fray: but soon you begin to hurl cups as well
in retaliation; and wipe your wounds with your napkin stained
with blood; as often as a pitched battle, begun with pitchers
of Saguntine ware, rages between you and the regiment
of freedmen. The great man himself drinks wine racked
from the wood under some consul with long hair,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and sips<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
the juice of the grape pressed in the Social war; never likely,
however, to send even a small glass to a friend, though sick
at heart. To-morrow, he will drink the produce of the
mountains of Alba or Setia,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> whose country and date age has
obliterated by the accumulated mould on the ancient amphora;
such wine as, with chaplets on their heads, Thrasea and Helvidius
used to drink on the birthdays of the Bruti and Cassius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Virro himself holds capacious cups formed of the tears of the
Heliades<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and phialæ incrusted with beryl. You are not
trusted with gold: or even if it is ever handed to you, a servant
is set as a guard over you at the same time, to count the
gems and watch your sharp nails. Forgive the precaution:
the jasper so much admired there is indeed a noble one: for,
like many others, Virro transfers to his cups the gems from off
his fingers, which the youth, preferred to the jealous Hiarbas,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
used to set on the front of his scabbard. You will drain a cup
with four noses, that bears the name of the cobbler of Beneventum,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
already cracked, and fit to be exchanged, as broken
glass, for brimstone.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>If your patron's stomach is overheated with wine and food,
he calls for water cooled by being boiled and then iced in
Scythian snow.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Did I complain just now that the wine set
before you was not the same as Virro's? Why, the very
water you drink is different. Your cups will be handed you
by a running footman from Gætulia, or the bony hand of
some Moor, so black that you would rather not meet him at
midnight, while riding through the tombs on the steep Latin
way. Before Virro himself stands the flower of Asia, purchased
at a greater sum than formed the whole revenue of the
warlike Tullus, or Ancus&mdash;and, not to detain you, the whole
fortunes<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> of all the kings of Rome. And so, when you are
thirsty, look behind you for your black Ganymede that comes
from Africa. A boy that costs so many thousands deigns not
to mix wine for the poor. Nay, his very beauty and bloom
of youth justify his sneer. When does he come near you?
When would he come, even if you called him, to serve you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>with hot or cold water? He scorns, forsooth, the idea of
obeying an old client, and that <em>you</em> should call for any thing
from his hand; and that you should recline at table, while he
has to stand. Every great house is proportionably full of
saucy menials.</p>

<p>See, too, with what grumbling another of these rascals
hands you bread that can scarce be broken; the mouldy fragments
of impenetrable crust, which would make your jaws
ache, and give you no chance of a bite. But delicate bread,
as white as snow, made of the finest flower, is reserved for the
great man. Mind you keep your hands off! Maintain the
respect due to the cutter of the bread!<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Imagine, however,
that you have been rather too forward; there stands over you
one ready to make you put it down. "Be so good, audacious
guest, as to help yourself from the bread-basket you have been
used to, and know the color of your own particular bread."
"So then!<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> it was for this, forsooth, that I so often quitted
my wife, and hurried up the steep ascent of the bleak Esquiline,
when the vernal sky rattled with the pelting of the pitiless
hail, and my great coat dripped whole showers of rain!"</p>

<p>See! with how vast a body the lobster which is served to
your patron fills the dish, and with what fine asparagus it is
garnished all round; with what a tail he seems to look down
in scorn on the assembled guests, when he comes in raised on
high by the hands of the tall slave. But to you is served a
common crab, scantily hedged in<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> with half an egg sliced, a
meal fit only for the dead,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and in a dish too small to hold it.
Virro himself drowns his fish in oil from Venafrum; but the
pale cabbage set before you, poor wretch, will stink of the
lamp. For in the sauceboats you are allowed, there is served
oil such as the canoe of the Micipsæ has imported in its sharp
prow; for which reason no one at Rome would bathe in the
same bath with Bocchor; which makes the blackamoors safe
even from the attacks of serpents.</p>

<p>Your patron will have a barbel furnished by Corsica, or
the rocks of Tauromenium, when all our own waters have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>been ransacked and failed; while gluttony is raging, and the
market is plying its unwearied nets in the neighboring seas,
and we do not allow the Tyrrhene fish to reach their full
growth. The provinces, therefore, have to supply our kitchen;
and thence we are furnished with what Lenas the legacy-hunter
may buy, and Aurelia sell again.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Virro is presented
with a lamprey of the largest size from the Sicilian whirlpool.
For while Auster keeps himself close, while he seats himself
and dries his wet pinions in prison, the nets,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> grown venturesome,
despise the dangers even of the middle of Charybdis.
An eel awaits you&mdash;first-cousin to the long snake&mdash;or a coarse
pike<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> from the Tiber, spotted from the winter's ice, a native
of the bank-side, fattened on the filth of the rushing sewer,
and used to penetrate the drain even of the middle of Suburra.</p>

<p>"I should like to have a word with Virro, if he would lend
an attentive ear. No one now expects from you such presents
as used to be sent by Seneca to his friends of humble
station, or the munificent gifts which the bountiful Piso or
Cotta used to dispense; for in days of old the glory of giving
was esteemed a higher honor than fasces or inscriptions.
All we ask is that you would treat us at supper like fellow-citizens.
Do this, and then, if you please, be, as many now-a-days
are, luxurious when alone, parsimonious to your
guests."</p>

<p>Before Virro himself is the liver of a huge goose; a fat
capon, as big as a goose; and a wild boar, worthy of the spear
of the yellow-haired Meleager, smokes. Then will be served
up truffles, if it happen to be spring, and the thunder, devoutly
wished for by the epicure, shall augment the supper. "Keep
your corn, O Libya," says Alledius, "unyoke your oxen; provided
only you send us truffles!" Meanwhile, that no single
source of vexation may be wanting, you will see the carver<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
capering and gesticulating with nimble knife, till he has gone
through all the directions of his instructor in the art. Nor
is it in truth a matter of trifling import with what an air a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>leveret or a hen is carved. You would be dragged by the
heels, like Cacus<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> when conquered by Hercules, and turned
out of doors, if you were ever to attempt to open your mouth,
as though you had three names.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> When does Virro pass the
cup to you, or take one that your lips have contaminated?
Which of you would be so rash, so lost to all sense of shame,
as to say, "Drink, sir!" to your patron lord? There are
very many things which men with coats worn threadbare
dare not say. If any god, or godlike hero, kinder to you
than the fates have been, were to give you a knight's estate,
what a great man would you, small mortal, become all at once
from nothing at all! What a dear friend of Virro's! "Give
this to Trebius!<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Set this before Trebius! My dear brother,
will you take some of this sweet-bread?"</p>

<p>O money! it is to thee he pays this honor! it is <em>thou</em>
and he are the brothers! But if you wish to be my lord, and
my lord's lord, let no little Æneas sport in your hall,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> or a
daughter more endearing than he. It is the barrenness of the
wife that makes a friend really agreeable and beloved. But
even suppose your Mycale should be confined, though she
should even present you three boys at a birth, he will be the
very one to be delighted with the twittering nest; will order
his green stomacher<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> to be brought, and the filberts,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and the
begged-for penny, whenever the infant parasite shall come to
dine with him.</p>

<p>Before his friends whom he holds so vile will be set some
very questionable toadstools&mdash;before the great man himself, a
mushroom<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>&mdash;but such an one as Claudius ate, <em>before</em> that
furnished by his wife, <em>after</em> which he ate nothing more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Virro will order to be served to himself and his brother Virros
such noble apples, on whose fragrance alone you are allowed
to revel; such as the eternal autumn of the Phæacians produced;
or such as you might fancy purloined from the African
sisters. You feast upon some shriveled windfall, such as is
munched at the ramparts by him that is armed with buckler
and helmet: and, in dread of the lash, learns to hurl his javelin
from the shaggy goat's<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> back.</p>

<p>You may imagine, perhaps, that Virro does all this from
stinginess. No! his very object is to vex you. For what
play, what mime is better than disappointed gluttony? All
this, therefore, is done, if you don't know it, that you may be
forced to give vent to your bile by your tears, and gnash long
your compressed teeth. You fancy yourself a freeman&mdash;the
great man's welcome guest! He looks upon you as one
caught by the savor of his kitchen. Nor does he conjecture
amiss. For who is so utterly destitute as twice to bear with
his insolence, if it has been his good fortune, when a boy, to
wear the Tuscan gold,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> or even the boss, the badge of leather,
that emblem of poverty.</p>

<p>The hope of a good dinner deludes you. "See! sure he'll
send us now a half-eaten hare, or a slice of that wild-boar
haunch.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Now we shall get that capon, as he has helped himself!"
Consequently you all sit in silent expectation, with
bread in hand, untouched and ready for action. And he that
uses you thus shows his wisdom&mdash;if you <em>can</em> submit to all these
things, then you <em>ought</em> to bear them. Some day or other, you
will present your head with shaven crown, to be beaten: nor
hesitate to submit to the harsh lash&mdash;well worthy of such a
banquet and such a friend as this!</p>

<h3>SATIRE VI.</h3>

<p>I believe that while Saturn still was king, chastity lingered
upon earth, and was long seen there: when a chill cavern
furnished a scanty dwelling, and inclosed in one common
shade the fire and household gods, the cattle, and their owners.
When a wife, bred on the mountains, prepared a rustic
bed with leaves and straw and the skins of the wild beasts
their neighbors; not like thee, Cynthia<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>&mdash;or thee whose beaming
eyes the death of a sparrow dimmed with tears&mdash;but bearing
breasts from which her huge infants might drink, not
suck, and often more uncivilized even than her acorn-belching
husband. Since men lived very differently then, when
the world was new, and the sky but freshly created, who,
born out of the riven oak, or moulded out of clay, had no
parents.</p>

<p>Many traces of primæval chastity, perhaps, or some few at
least, may have existed, even under Jove; but then it was before
Jove's beard was grown; before the Greeks were yet
ready to swear by another's head; when no one feared a thief
for his cabbages or apples, but lived with garden uninclosed.
Then by degrees Astræa retired to the realms above, with
chastity for her companion, and the two sisters fled together.</p>

<p>To violate the marriage-bed, and laugh to scorn the genius
that presides over the nuptial couch, is an ancient and a hackneyed
vice, Postumus. Every other species of iniquity the
age of iron soon produced. The silver age witnessed the first
adulterers.</p>

<p>And yet are you preparing your marriage covenant, and
the settlement,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and betrothal, in our days, and are already
under the hands of the master barber, and perhaps have already
given the pledge for her finger! Well! you <em>used</em> to be
sane, at all events! You, Postumus, going to marry! Say,
what Tisiphone, what snakes are driving you mad? Can you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>submit to be the slave of any woman, while so many halters
are to be had? so long as high and dizzy windows are open
for you, and the Æmilian bridge presents itself so near at
hand? Or if, out of so many ways of quitting life, none
pleases you, do you not think your present plan better, of
having a stripling to sleep with you, who lying there, reads
you no curtain lectures, exacts no little presents from you,
and never complains that you are too sparing in your efforts
to please him?</p>

<p>But Ursidius is delighted with the Julian law<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>&mdash;he thinks
of bringing up a darling heir, nor cares to lose the fine turtledove
and bearded mullets,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and all the baits for legacies in
the dainties of the market. What will you believe to be impossible,
if Ursidius takes a wife? If he, of yore the most
notorious of adulterers, whom the chest of Latinus in peril of
his life has so often concealed, is now going to insert his idiot
head in the nuptial halter; nay, and more than this, is looking
out for a wife possessed of the virtues of ancient days! Haste,
physicians, bore through the middle vein! What a nice man!
Fall prostrate at the threshold of Tarpeian Jove, and sacrifice
to Juno a heifer with gilded horns, if you have the rare
good fortune to find a matron with unsullied chastity. So few
are there worthy to handle the fillets of Ceres; so few, whose
kisses their own fathers might not dread. Wreathe chaplets
for the door-posts, stretch thick clusters of ivy over the
threshold. Is one husband enough for Iberina? Sooner
will you prevail on her to be content with one eye. "Yet
there is a great talk of a certain damsel, living at her father's
country-house!" Let her live at Gabii as she lived in the
country, or even at Fidenæ, and I grant what you say of
the influence of the paternal country-seat. Yet who will
dare assert that nothing has been achieved on mountains
or in caves? Are Jupiter and Mars grown so old. In
all the public walks can a woman be pointed out to you,
that is worthy of your wish. On all their benches do the
public shows hold one that you could love without misgivings;
or one you could pick out from the rest? While the
effeminate Bathyllus is acting Leda in the ballet, Tuccia
can not contain herself, Appula whines as in the feat of love,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Thymele is all attention to the quick, the gentler, and the
slow; and so Thymele, rustic as she was before, becomes a proficient
in the art. But others, whenever the stage ornaments,
packed away, get a respite, and the courts alone are vocal
(since the theatres are closed and empty, and the Megalesian
games come a long time after the plebeian), in their melancholy
handle the mask and thyrsus and drawers of Accius.
Urbicus provokes a laugh by his personification of Autonoe in
the Atellan farce. Ælia, being poor, is in love with him. For
others, the fibula of the comic actor is unbuckled for a large
sum. Some women prevent Chrysogonus from having voice
to sing. Hispulla delights in a tragic actor. Do you expect
then that the worthy Quintilianus will be the object of their
love? You take a wife by whom Echion the harper, or Glaphyrus,
or Ambrosius the choral flute-player, will become a
father. Let us erect long lines of scaffolding along the narrow
streets. Let the door-posts and the gate be decorated with a
huge bay, that beneath the canopy inlaid with tortoise-shell,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
thy infant, Lentulus, supposed to be sprung from a noble sire,
may be the counterpart of the Mirmillo Euryalus.</p>

<p>Hippia, though wife to a senator, accompanied a gladiator to
Pharos and the Nile, and the infamous walls of Lagos.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Even
Canopus itself reprobated the immorality of the imperial city.
She, forgetful of her home, her husband, and her sister, showed
no concern for her native land, or, vile wretch as she was, her
weeping children, and, to amaze you even more, quitted the
shows and Paris. But though when a babe she had been pillowed
in great luxury, in the down of her father's mansion,
and a cradle of richest workmanship, she despised the perils
of the sea. Her good name she had long before despised&mdash;the
loss of which, among the soft cushions of ladies, is very
cheaply held. Therefore with undaunted breast she faced
the Tuscan waves and wide-resounding Ionian Sea, though
the sea was so often to be changed. If the cause of the peril
be reasonable and creditable, then they are alarmed&mdash;their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>coward hearts are chilled with icy fear&mdash;they can not support
themselves on their trembling feet. They show a dauntless
spirit in those things which they basely dare. If it is their
husband that bids them, it is a great hardship to go on board
ship. Then the bilgewater is insufferable! the skies spin
round them! She that follows her adulterer has no qualms.
The one is sick all over her husband. The other dines among
the sailors and walks the quarter-deck, and delights in handling
the hard ropes. And yet what was the beauty that inflamed,
what the prime of life that captivated Hippia? What
was it she saw in him to compensate her for being nicknamed
the fencer's whore? For the darling Sergius had now begun
to shave his throat; and badly wounded in the arm to anticipate
his discharge. Besides, he had many things to disfigure
his face, as for instance&mdash;he was galled with his helmet,
and had a huge wen between his nostrils, and acrid rheum forever
trickling from his eye. But then he was a gladiator! It
is this that makes them beautiful as Hyacinthus! It was this
she preferred to her children and her native land, her sister
and her husband. It is the steel they are enamored of. This
very same Sergius, if discharged from the arena, would begin
to be Veiento in her eyes.</p>

<p>Do you feel an interest in a private house, in a Hippia's
acts? Turn your eyes to the rivals of the gods! Hear what
Claudius had to endure. As soon as his wife perceived he
was asleep, this imperial harlot, that dared prefer a coarse
mattress to the royal bed, took her hood she wore by nights,
quitted the palace with but a single attendant, but with a
yellow tire concealing her black hair; entered the brothel
warm with the old patchwork quilt, and the cell vacant and
appropriated to herself. Then took her stand with naked
breasts and gilded nipples, assuming the name of Lycisca, and
displayed the person of the mother of the princely Britannicus,
received all comers with caresses and asked her compliment,
and submitted to often-repeated embraces. Then when the
owner dismissed his denizens, sadly she took her leave, and
(all she could do) lingered to the last before she closed her
cell; and still raging with unsatisfied desire, tired with the
toil but yet unsated, she retired with sullied cheeks defiled,
and, foul from the smoke of lamps, bore back the odor of the
stews to the pillow of the emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Shall I speak of the love-philters, the incantations, the
poison mingled with the food and given to the step-son? The
acts which they commit, to which they are impelled by the
imperative suggestions of their sex,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> are still more atrocious:
those they commit through lust are the least of their crimes.
"Then, how can it be that even by her husband's showing
Cesennia is the best of wives?" She brought him a thousand
sestertia! that is the price at which he calls her chaste. It is
not with Venus' quiver that he grows thin, or with her torch
he burns; it is from that his fires are fed; from her dowry
that the arrows emanate. She has purchased her liberty:
therefore, even in her husband's presence, she may exchange
signals, and answer her love-letters. A rich wife, with a
covetous husband, has all a widow's privileges. "Why then
does Sertorius burn with passion for Bibula?" If you sift
the truth, it is not the wife he is in love with, but the face.
Let a wrinkle or two make their appearance, and the shriveled
skin grow flaccid, her teeth get black, or her eyes smaller&mdash;"Pack
up your baggage," the freedman will say, "and march.
You are become offensive. You blow your nose too frequently.
March! and be quick about it! Another is coming
whose nose is not so moist." Meanwhile she is hot and
imperious, and demands of her husband shepherds and sheep
from Canusium, and elms<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> from Falernum. What a trifle is
this? Then every boy she fancies, whole droves of slaves, and
whatever she has not in her house, and her neighbor has, must
be bought.</p>

<p>Nay, in the mid-winter month, when now the merchant
Jason is shut up, and the cottage<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> white with hoar frost detains
the sailors all equipped for their voyage, she takes huge
crystalline vases,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and then again myrrhine of immense size;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>then an adamant whose history is well known, and whose
value is enhanced by having been on Berenice's finger. This
in days of yore a barbarian king gave his incestuous love&mdash;Agrippa
to his own sister! where barefoot kings observe
festal sabbaths, and a long-established clemency grants long
life to pigs.</p>

<p>"Is there not one, then, out of such large herds of women,
that seems to you a worthy match?" Let her be beautiful,
graceful, rich, fruitful; marshal along her porticoes her rows
of ancestral statues; let her be more chaste than any single
Sabine that, with hair disheveled, brought the war to a close;
be a very phœnix upon earth, rare as a black swan; who
could tolerate a wife in whom all excellencies are concentrated!
I would rather, far rather, have a country maiden
from Venusia, than you, O Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, if
along with your exalted virtues you bring as portion of your
dower a haughty and disdainful brow, and reckon as part of
your fortune the triumphs of your house! Away, I beg, with
your Hannibal and Syphax conquered in his camp, and tramp
with all your Carthage!</p>

<p>"Spare, I pray thee, Pæan! and thou, O goddess, lay down
thine arrows! The children are innocent. Transfix the
mother herself!" So prays Amphion. Yet Pæan bends his
bow. Therefore she had to bury her herds of children, together
with their sire, while Niobe seems to herself to be more
noble than Latona's race, and moreover more fruitful even
than the white sow. What dignity of deportment, what
beauty, can compensate for your wife's always throwing her
own worth in your teeth? For all the satisfaction of this
rare and chief good is destroyed, if, entirely spoilt by haughtiness
of soul, it entails more bitter than sweet. But who is
so devotedly uxorious, as not to feel a dread of her whom he
praises to the skies, and hate her seven hours out of every
twelve? There are some things, trifling indeed, and yet such
as no husband can tolerate. For what can be more sickening
than the fact that no one woman considers herself beautiful,
unless instead of Tuscan she has become a little Greek&mdash;metamorphosed
from a maid of Sulmo to a "maid of Athens."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Every thing is in Greek. (While surely it is more disgraceful
for our countrywomen not to know their mother tongue.)
In this language they give vent to their fears, their anger,
their joys and cares, and all the inmost workings of their
soul. Nay more, they kiss à la Grecque! This in young
girls you may excuse. But must thou, forsooth, speak Greek,
that hast had the wear and tear of six and eighty years? In
an old woman this language becomes immodest, when interspersed
with the wanton Ζωὴ καὶ ψυχή. You are employing
in public, expressions one might think you had just used under
the counterpane. For whose passion would not be excited
by these enticing and wanton words? It has all the
force of actual touching. Yet though you pronounce them
all in more insinuating tones than even Hæmus or Carpophorus,
your face, the tell-tale of your years, makes all the
feathers droop.</p>

<p>If you are <em>not</em> likely to love her that is contracted and
united to you in lawful wedlock, there seems no single reason
why you should marry, nor why you should waste the wedding
dinner and bride cakes<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> which you must dispense, when
their complimentary attendance is over, to your bridal guests
already well crammed; nor the present given for the first
nuptial night, when, in the well-stored dish, Dacicus<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and
Germanicus glitters with its golden legend. If you are possessed
of such simplicity of character as to be enamored
of your wife, and your whole soul is devoted to her alone,
then bow your head with neck prepared to bear the yoke.
You will find none that will spare a man that loves her.
Though she be enamored herself, she delights in tormenting
and fleecing her lover. Consequently a wife is far more disastrous
to him that is likely to prove a kind and eligible husband.
You will never be allowed to make a present without your
wife's consent. If she opposes it, you must not sell a single
thing, or buy one, against her will. She will give away your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>affections. That good old friend of many long years will be
shut out from that gate that saw his first sprouting beard.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
While pimps and trainers have free liberty to make their own
wills, and even gladiators enjoy the same amount of privilege,
you will have your will dictated to you, and find more than
one rival named as your heirs.</p>

<p>"Crucify that slave." "What is the charge, to call for
such a punishment? What witness can you produce? Who
gave the information? Listen! Where man's life is at stake
no deliberation can be too long." "Idiot! so a slave is a man
then! Granted he has done nothing. I <em>will</em> it, I <em>insist</em> on it!
Let my will stand instead of reason!"</p>

<p>Therefore she lords it over her husband:&mdash;but soon she
quits these realms, and seeks new empires and wears out her
bridal veil. Then she flies back, and seeks again the traces
of the bed she scorned.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> She leaves the doors so recently
adorned, the tapestry still hanging on the house, and the
branches still green upon the threshold. Thus the number
grows: thus she has her eight<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> husbands in five years. A
notable fact to record upon her tomb!</p>

<p>All chance of domestic happiness is hopeless while your
wife's mother is alive. She bids her exult in despoiling her
husband to the utmost. She teaches her how to write back
nothing savoring of discourtesy or inexperience to the missives
of the seducer. She either balks or bribes your spies;
then, though your daughter is in rude health, calls in Archigenes,
and tosses off the bedclothes as too oppressive. Meanwhile
the adulterer, concealed apart, stands trembling with
impatient expectation. Do you expect, forsooth, that the
mother will inculcate virtuous principles, or other than she
cherishes herself? It is right profitable too for a depraved
old hag to train her daughter to the same depravity.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a single cause in which a woman is not
engaged in some way in fomenting the suit. If Manilia is
not defendant, she will be plaintiff. They draw up and frame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>bills of indictment unassisted,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> quite prepared to dictate even
to Celsus<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> the exordium and topics he should use.</p>

<p>The Tyrian Endromides<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and the Ceroma for women who
is ignorant of? Or who has not seen the wounds of the
Plastron,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> which she dints with unwearied foil, and attacks
with her shield, and goes with precision through her exercise?
A matron most pre-eminently worthy of the trumpet
of the Floralia. Unless indeed in that breast of hers she is
plotting something deeper, and training in real earnest for
the amphitheatre.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> What modesty can a woman show that
wears a helmet, and eschews her sex, and delights in feats of
strength? And yet, in spite of all, this virago would not wish
to become a man. For how small is our pleasure compared
to theirs! Yet what a goodly array would there be, if there
were an auction of your wife's goods: belt and gauntlets<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and
crest, and the half-armor for the left leg! Or if she shall
engage in a different way of fighting,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> you will be lucky indeed
when your young wife sells her greaves. Yet these
very same women perspire even in their muslin; whose delicate
frames even a slip of sarcenet oppresses. See! with what
a noise she makes the home-thrusts taught her by the trainer,
and what a weight of helmet bows her down, how firmly she
plants herself on her haunches, in what a thick mass is the
roll of clothes. Then smile when, laying aside her arms, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>takes her oblong vessel. Tell me, ye granddaughters of Lepidus
or blind Metellus, or Fabius Gurges, what actress ever
wore a dress like this? When would Asylus' wife cry Hah!
at the Plastron?</p>

<p>The bed in which a wife lies is the constant scene of quarrels
and mutual recriminations. There is little chance of
sleep there. Then is she indeed bitter toward her husband,
fiercer than tigress robbed of her whelps; when, conscious of
her secret guilt, she counterfeits groans, or hates the servants,
or upbraids you with some rival of her own creation, with
tears ever fruitful, ever ready at their post, and only waiting
her command in what way to flow. You believe it genuine
love. You, poor hedge-sparrow, plume yourself, and kiss off
the tears! Ah! what amorous lays, what letters would you
read, if you were but to examine the writing-case of that
adulteress that counterfeits jealousy so well!</p>

<p>But suppose her actually caught in the arms of a slave or
knight. "Pray suggest in this case some colorable excuse,
Quintilian!" "We are at fault! Let the lady herself speak!"
"It was formerly agreed," she says, "that you should do what
you pleased, and that I also might have full power to gratify
myself. In spite of your outcry and confounding heaven and
sea, I am mortal." Nothing is more audacious than these
women when detected. They affect resentment, and borrow
courage from their very guilt itself.</p>

<p>Yet should you ask whence are these unnatural prodigies,
or from what source they spring; it was their humble fortune
that made the Latin women chaste in days of yore, nor
did hard toil and short nights' rest, and hands galled and hardened<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
with the Tuscan fleece, and Hannibal close to the city,
and their husbands mounting guard at the Colline tower,
suffer their lowly roofs to be contaminated by vice. Now we
are suffering all the evils of long-continued peace. Luxury,
more ruthless than war, broods over Rome, and exacts vengeance
for a conquered world. No guilt or deed of lust is
wanting, since Roman poverty has disappeared. This was the
source whence Sybaris flowed to these seven hills, and Rhodes
too, and Miletus, and Tarentum crowned with garlands, insolent
and flushed with wine!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Money, the nurse of debauchery, was the first that introduced
foreign manners, and enervating riches sapped the sinews
of the age with foul luxury. For what cares Venus in
her cups? All difference of head or tail is alike to her who
at very midnight devours huge oysters, when unguents mixed
with neat Falernian foam, when she drains the conch,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> when
from her dizziness the roof seems to reel, and the table to rise
up with the lights doubled in number.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Go then, and knowing
all this, doubt, if you can, with what a snort of scorn Tullia
snuffs up the air when she passes the ancient altar of
Chastity; or what Collatia says to her accomplice Maura.
Here they set down their litters at night, and bedew the very
image of the goddess with copious irrigations, while the chaste
moon witnesses their abominations,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> over which, when morn
returns, you pass on your way to visit your great friends.</p>

<p>The secrets of Bona Dea are well known. When the pipe
excites them, and inflamed alike with the horn and wine,
these Mænads of Priapus rush wildly round, and whirl their
locks and howl! Then, as their passions rise, how burning
is their lust, how frantic their words, when all power of restraining
their desires is lost! A prize is proposed, and
Saufeia<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> challenges the vilest of her sex, and bears off the
prize. In these games nothing is counterfeit, all is acted to
the life; so that even the aged Priam, effete from years, or
Nestor himself, might be inflamed at the sight. Then their
lust admits of no delay. Then the woman appears in all her
native depravity; and by all alike is the shout re-echoed from
the whole den&mdash;"Now is the proper time. Let in the men!"
But the adulterer still sleeps; so she bids the youth put on a
female hood, and speed to the spot. If none can be found,
they have recourse to slaves. If there is no hope of slaves,
they will hire some water-carrier to come. If this fails too,
and no men can be found, she would not hesitate to descend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>still lower in the scale of creation. Oh, would that our
ancient rites and public worship could at least be celebrated,
uncontaminated by such pollutions as these! But even the
Moors and Indians know what singing wench produced his
wares equal in bulk to Cæsar's two Anticatos, in a place
whence even a mouse, conscious of his sex, would flee, and
every picture is veiled over that represents the other sex.
Yet, even in those days, what man despised the deity? or
who had dared to ridicule Numa's earthen bowl and black
dish, and the brittle vessels from Mount Vatican. But now
what altars are there that a Clodius does not assail?</p>

<p>I hear the advice that my good friends of ancient days
would give&mdash;"Put on a lock! keep her in confinement!"
But who is to guard the guards themselves? Your wife is
as cunning as you, and begins with them. And, in our days,
the highest and the lowest are fired with the same lust. Nor
is she that wears out the black pavement with her feet, better
than she who is borne on the shoulders of her tall Syrian
slaves.</p>

<p>Ogulnia, in order that she may go in due state to the games,
hires a dress, and attendants, and a sedan, and pillow, and
female friends; and a nurse, and yellow-haired girl<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> to whom
she may issue her commands. Yet all that remains of her
family plate, and even the very last remnants of it,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> she gives
to well-oiled Athletes. Many women are in straitened circumstances
at home; yet none of them has the modest selfrestraint
that should accompany poverty, or limits herself
within that measure which her poverty has allotted and assigned
to her. Yet <em>men</em> do sometimes look forward to what
may be to their interest hereafter, and, with the ant for their
instructress, some have at last felt a dread of cold and hunger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Yet woman, in her prodigality, perceives not that her fortune
is fast coming to naught; and as though money, with vegetative
power, would bloom afresh<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> from the drained chest, and
the heap from which she takes would be ever full, she never
reflects how great a sum her pleasures cost her. Some women
ever take delight in unwarlike eunuchs, and soft kisses, and
the loss of all hope of beard, that precludes the necessity of
abortives. Yet the summit of their pleasure is when this
operation has been performed in the heat and prime of manhood,
and the only loss sustained is that the surgeon Heliodorus
cheats the barber of his fees. Such is his mistress'
will: and, conspicuous from afar, and attracting the eyes of
all, he enters the baths, and vies even with the god that
guards our vines and gardens. Let him sleep with his mistress!
But, Postumus, suffer not the youthful Bromius to
enter the lists with him.</p>

<p>If she takes delight in singing, the fibula of none of
these fellows that sells his voice to the prætor holds out:
the instruments are forever in her hands; the whole lyre
sparkles with the jewels thickly set. She runs over the
strings with the vibrating quill,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> with which the soft Hedymeles
performed: this she holds in her hands; with this she
consoles herself, and lavishes kisses on the plectrum, dear
for its owner's sake. One of the clan of the Lamiæ,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> a
lady of lofty rank, inquired with meal-cake and wine of
Janus and Vesta, whether Pollio might venture to hope for
the oaken crown at the Capitoline games,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and promise it to
his lyre. What more could she do were her husband sick?
What, if the physicians had despaired of her infant son?
She stood before the altar, and thought no shame to veil her
head for a harper: and went through in due form the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>prescribed,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and grew pale as the lamb was opened. Tell me
now, I pray, tell me, thou ancientest of gods, father Janus!
dost thou return answer to these? Great must be indeed the
leisure<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> of heaven! There can be no business there, as far as
I see, stirring among you. One woman consults you about
comic actors; another would fain commend a tragedian to your
notice: the soothsayer will become varicose.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>But let her rather be musical than fly through the whole
city, with bold bearing; and encounter the assemblies of
men, and in her husband's presence herself converse with
generals in their scarlet cloaks,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> with unabashed face and
breasts exposed. She too knows all that is going on in the
whole world&mdash;what the Seres<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> or Thracians are engaged in&mdash;the
secrets of the step-mother and her son&mdash;what adulterer is
in love, or is in great request. She will tell you who made
the widow pregnant&mdash;in what month it was&mdash;in what language
and manner each act of love takes place. She is the
first<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> to see the comet that menaces the Armenian and Parthian
king; and she intercepts<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> at the gates the reports and
freshest news. Some she invents as well. That Niphates<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>has overwhelmed whole nations, and that the whole country
is there laid under water by a great deluge; that cities are
tottering, the earth sinking down&mdash;this she tells in every
place of resort to every one she meets.</p>

<p>And yet that vice is not more intolerable, than that, though
earnestly entreated,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> she will seize upon her poor neighbors,
and have them cut in two with lashes. For if her sound
slumbers are disturbed by the barking of a dog, "Bring the
clubs<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> here at once!" she cries: and orders the owner first to
be beaten with them, and then the dog. Terrible to encounter,
most awful in visage, she enters the baths by night&mdash;by night
she orders her bathing vessels and camp to be set in motion.
She delights in perspiring with great tumult; when her arms
have sunk down wearied with the heavy dumb-bells; and the
sly anointer has omitted to rub down no part of her body.
Her poor wretches of guests meanwhile are overcome with
drowsiness and hunger. At last the lady comes; flushed, and
thirsty enough for a whole flagon,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> which is placed at her feet
and filled from a huge pitcher: of which a second pint is
drained before she tastes food, to make her appetite<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> quite
ravenous. Then having rinsed out her stomach, the wine returns
in a cascade on the floor&mdash;rivers gush over the marble
pavement,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> or the broad vessel reeks of Falernian&mdash;for thus,
just as when a long snake has glided into a deep cask, she
drinks and vomits. Therefore her husband turns sick; and
with eyes closed smothers his rising bile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet that woman is more offensive still, who, as soon as
she has taken her place at table, praises Virgil, and excuses
the suicide of Dido: matches and compares poets together:
in one scale weighs Maro in the balance, and Homer in the
other. The grammarians yield; rhetoricians are confuted;
the whole company is silenced; neither lawyer nor crier<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> can
put in a word, nor even another woman. Such a torrent of
words pours forth, you would say so many basins or bells
were all being struck at once. Henceforth let no one trouble
trumpets or brazen vessels; she will be able singly to relieve
the moon when suffering<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> an eclipse. The philosopher sets a
limit even to those things which are good in themselves. For
she that desires to appear too learned and eloquent, ought to
wear a tunic reaching only to the middle of the leg, to sacrifice
a pig to Sylvanus,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and bathe for a quadrans. Let not
the matron that shares your marriage-bed possess a set style
of eloquence, or hurl in well-rounded sentence the enthymeme
curtailed<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> of its premiss; nor be acquainted with all histories.
But let there be some things in books which she does not understand.
I hate her who is forever poring over and studying
Palæmon's<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> treatise; who never violates the rules and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>principles of grammar; and skilled in antiquarian lore, quotes
verses I never knew; and corrects the phrases of her friend
as old-fashioned,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> which men would never heed. A husband
should have the privilege of committing a solecism.</p>

<p>There is nothing a woman will not allow herself, nothing
she holds disgraceful, when she has encircled her neck with
emeralds, and inserted earrings of great size in her ears,
stretched with their weight. Nothing is more unbearable
than a rich woman!</p>

<p>Meanwhile her face, shocking to look at, or ridiculous from
the large poultice, is all swollen; or is redolent of rich Poppæan
unguents,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> with which the lips of her wretched husband are
glued up. She will present herself to her adulterer with
skin washed clean. When does she choose to appear beautiful
at home? It is for the adulterers her perfumes are prepared.
It is for these she purchases all that the slender Indians
send us. At length she uncases her face and removes
the first layer. She begins to be herself again; and bathes
in that milk,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> for which she carries in her train she-asses, even
if sent an exile to Hyperborean climes. But that which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>overlaid and fomented with so many and oft-changed cosmetics,
and receives poultices of boiled and damp flour, shall we call
it a face,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> or a sore?</p>

<p>It is worth while to find out exactly what their occupations
and pursuits are through the livelong day. If her husband
has gone to sleep with his back toward her, the housekeeper is
half killed&mdash;the tire-women are stripped to be whipped&mdash;the
Liburnian slave is accused of having come behind his time,
and is forced to pay the penalty of another's sleep; one has
rods broken<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> about him, another bleeds from the whips, a third
from the cowhide. Some women pay a regular salary to
their torturers. While he lashes she is employed in enameling
her face. She listens to her friend's chat, or examines
the broad gold of an embroidered robe. Still he lashes. She
pores over the items in her long diary.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Still he lashes. Until
at length, when the torturers are exhausted, "Begone!"
she thunders out in awful voice, the inquisition being now
complete.</p>

<p>The government of her house is no more merciful than the
court of a Sicilian tyrant. For if she has made an assignation,
and is anxious to be dressed out more becomingly than
usual, and is in a hurry, and has been some time already
waited for in the gardens, or rather near the chapels of the
Isiac<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> procuress; poor Psecas arranges her hair, herself with
disheveled locks and naked shoulders and naked breasts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
"Why is this curl too high?" Instantly the cowhide avenges
the heinous crime of the misplacing of a hair. What has poor
Psecas done? What crime is it of the poor girl's if your own
nose has displeased you?</p>

<p>Another, on the left hand, draws out and combs her curls
and rolls them into a band. The aged matron assists at the
council, who, having served her due period<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> at the needle, now
presides over weighing out the tasks of wool. Her opinion
will be first taken. Then those who are her inferiors in years
and skill will vote in order, as though their mistress's good
name or life were at stake. So great is the anxiety of getting
beauty! Into so many tiers she forms her curls, so many
stages high she builds<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> her head; in front you will look upon
an Andromache, behind she is a dwarf&mdash;you would imagine
her another person. Excuse her, pray, if nature has assigned
her but a short back, and if, without the aid of high-heeled
buskins, she looks shorter than a Pigmy<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> maiden; and must
spring lightly up on tip-toe for a kiss. No thought meanwhile
about her husband! not a word of her ruinous expenditure!
She lives as though she were merely a neighbor<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> of her husband's,
and in this respect alone is nearer to him&mdash;that she
hates her husband's friends and slaves, and makes grievous
inroads on his purse.</p>

<p>But see! the chorus of the maddened Bellona and the
mother of the gods enters the house! and the huge eunuch
(a face to be revered by his obscene inferior) who long ago
emasculated himself with a broken shell; to whom his hoarse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>troop and the plebeian drummers give place, and whose cheek
is covered with his Phrygian tiara. With voice grandiloquent
he bids her dread the approach of September and the autumn
blasts, unless she purifies herself with a hecatomb of eggs, and
makes a present to him of her cast-off murrey-colored<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> robes:
that whatever unforeseen or mighty peril may be impending
over her may pass into the tunics, and at once expiate the
whole year. She will break the ice and plunge into the river
in the depth of winter, or dip three times in Tiber at early
dawn, and bathe her timid head in its very eddies, and thence
emerging will crawl on bleeding knees, naked and shivering,
over the whole field of the haughty king.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> If white Io command,
she will go to the extremity of Egypt, and bring back
water fetched from scorching Meroë, to sprinkle on the temple
of Isis, that rears itself hard by the ancient sheepfold.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
For she believes that the warning is given her by the voice
of the goddess herself. And this, forsooth, is a fit soul and
mind<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> for the gods to hold converse with by night! He therefore
gains the chief and highest honor, who, surrounded by
his linen-robed flock,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> and a bald-headed throng of people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>uttering lamentations, runs to and fro personating the grinning
Anubis. He it is that supplicates for pardon whenever
the wife does not refrain from nuptial joys on days to be observed
as sacred, and a heavy penalty is incurred from the
violation of the snowy sheeting. And the silver serpent was
seen to nod his head! His are the tears, and his the studied
mumblings, that prevail on Osiris not to withhold pardon for
her fault, when bribed by a fat goose and a thin cake. When
he has withdrawn, some trembling Jewess, having quitted
her basket and hay, begs in her secret ear, the interpretess
of the laws of Solyma, the potent priestess of the tree&mdash;the
trusty go-between from highest heaven!<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> And she crosses
her hand with money, but sparingly enough: for Jews will
sell you any dreams you please for the minutest coin. The
soothsayer of Armenia or Commagene,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> handling the liver of
the dove still reeking, engages that her lover shall be devoted,
or promises the rich inheritance of some childless rich man;
he pries into the breasts of chickens and the entrails of a
puppy; sometimes too even of a child&mdash;he does acts of which
he will himself turn informer!<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>But their confidence in Chaldæans will be greater still:
whatever the astrologer tells them, they will believe reported
straight from the fountain of Ammon; since at Delphi the
oracles are dumb, and darkness as to the future is the punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>of the human race. However, of these he is in the
highest repute who has been often banished; by whose friendship
and venal<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> tablets it came to pass that a citizen of high
rank<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> died, and one dreaded by Otho. Hence arises confidence
in his art, if both his hands have clanked with chains, and he
has been long an inmate of the camp-prison. No astrologer
that has never been condemned will have any reputation for
genius; but he that has hardly escaped with his life, and
scarcely had good fortune enough to be sent to one of the Cyclades,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
and at length to be set free from the confined Seriphos,
he it is whom your Tanaquil<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> consults about the death of her
jaundiced mother, for which she has been long impatient; but
first, about yourself! when she may hope to follow to the
grave her sister and her uncles; whether her adulterer will
survive her, for what greater boon than this have the gods in
their power to bestow?</p>

<p>And yet she is ignorant what the ill-omened planet of
Saturn forebodes; with what star Venus presents herself in
fortunate conjunction; what is the month for ill-luck; what
seasons are assigned to profit.</p>

<p>Remember to shun even a casual meeting with her in whose
hands you see, like the unctuous amber,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> their calendars well
thumbed; who instead of consulting others is now herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>consulted; who when her husband is going to join his camp
or revisit his home, will refuse to accompany him if restrained
by the calculations of Thrasyllus.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> When it is her fancy to
ride as far as the first mile-stone, the lucky hour is taken from
her book; if the corner of her eye itches when she rubs it,
she calls for ointment after a due inspection of her horoscope:
though she lies sick in bed no hour appears suited to taking
food, save that which Petosiris<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> has directed. If she be of
moderate means, she will traverse the space on both sides of
the pillars of the circus, and draw lots, and present her forehead
and her hand to the fortune-teller that asks for the frequent
palming. The rich will obtain answers from some
soothsayer of Phrygia or India hired for the purpose, from
some one skilled in the stars and heavens, or one advanced in
years who expiates the public places which the lightning<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> has
struck. The destiny of the plebeians is learnt in the circus,
and at Tarquin's rampart.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> She that has no long necklace
of gold to display, inquires in front of the obelisks and the
dolphin-columns,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> whether she shall jilt the tapster and marry
the old-clothes man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet these, when circumstances so require, are ready to encounter
the perils of childbirth, and endure all the irksome
toils of nursing. But rarely does a gilded bed contain a
woman lying-in: so potent are the arts and drugs of her that
can insure barrenness, and for bribes kill men while yet unborn.
Yet grieve not at this, poor wretch! and with thine
own hand give thy wife the potion, whatever it be: for did
she choose to bear her leaping children in her womb, thou
wouldst perchance become the sire of an Æthiop; a blackamoor
would soon be your sole heir, one whom you would not
see of a morning.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>I say nothing of supposititious children, and all a husband's
joys and fond hopes baffled at the dirty pools;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and the Pontifices
and Salii selected thence, who are to bear in their
counterfeit persons the noble name of Scauri. Fortune, that
delights in mischief, takes her stand by night and smiles upon
the naked babes. All these she cherishes and fosters in her
bosom: then proffers them to the houses of the great, and
prepares in secret a rich sport for herself. These she dotes
on:<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> on these she forces her favors; and smiling, leads them
on to advancement as her own foster-children.</p>

<p>One fellow offers a wife magical incantations. Another sells
her love potions from Thessaly, to give her power to disturb her
husband's intellects, and punish him with the indignity of the
slipper. To these it is owing that you are reduced to dotage:
hence comes that dizziness of brain, that strange forgetfulness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>of things that you have but just now done. Yet even this is
endurable, if you do not go raving mad as well, like that uncle
of Nero for whom his Cæsonia infused the whole forehead of
a foal new dropped. Who will not follow where the empress
leads? All things were wrapped in flames and with joints disruptured
were tottering to their fall, exactly as if Juno had
driven her spouse to madness. Therefore the mushroom<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> of
Agrippina had far less of guilt: since that stopped the breath
but of a single old man, and bade his trembling head descend
to heaven,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> and his lips that slavered with dribbling saliva.
Whereas this potion of Cæsonia<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> calls aloud for fire and sword
and tortures, and mangles in one bloody mass both senators
and knights. So potent is a mare's offspring! Such mighty
ruin can one sorceress work!</p>

<p>Women hate their husbands' spurious issue. No one would
object to or forbid that. But now it is thought allowable to
kill even their husbands' sons by a former marriage.</p>

<p>Take my warning, ye that are under age and have a large
estate, keep watch over your lives! trust not a single dish!
The rich meats steam, livid with poison of your mother's mixing.
Let some one take a bite before you of whatever she
that bore you hands you; let your pedagogue, in terror of his
life, be taster of your cups.</p>

<p>All this is our invention! and Satire is borrowing the tragic
buskin, forsooth; and transgressing the limits prescribed by
those who trod the path before us, we are wildly declaiming in
the deep-mouthed tones of Sophocles<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> a strain of awful grandeur,
unknown to the Rutulian hills and Latin sky. Would
that it were but fable! But Pontia<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> with loud voice exclaims,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>"I did the deed. I avow it! and prepared for my own children
the aconite, which bears palpable evidence against me.
Still<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> the act was mine!" "What, cruelest of vipers! didst
thou kill two at one meal! Two, didst thou slay?" "Ay,
seven, had there haply been seven!"</p>

<p>Then let us believe to be true all that tragedians say
of the fierce Colchian or of Progne. I attempt not to gainsay
it. Yet they perpetrated atrocities that were monstrous
even in their days&mdash;but not for the sake of money. Less
amazement is excited even by the greatest enormities, whenever
rage incites this sex to crime, and with fury burning up
their very liver, they are carried away headlong; like rocks
torn away from cliffs, from which the mountain-height is reft
away, and the side recedes from the impending mass.</p>

<p>I can not endure the woman that makes her calculations,
and in cold blood perpetrates a heinous crime. They sit and
see Alcestis<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> on the stage encountering death for her husband,
and were a similar exchange allowed to them, would gladly
purchase a lapdog's life by the sacrifice of their husband's!
You will meet any morning with Danaides and Eriphylæ in
plenty; not a street but will possess its Clytæmnestra. This
is the only difference, that that famed daughter of Tyndarus
grasped in both hands a bungling, senseless axe.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> But now
the business is dispatched with the insinuating venom of a
toad. But yet with the steel too; if her Atrides has been
cautious enough to fortify himself with the Pontic antidotes
of the thrice-conquered<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> king.</p>

turba." Isis is said to have been a queen of Egypt, and to have
taught her subjects the use of linen, for which reason the inferior priests
were all clothed in it. All who were about to celebrate her sacred rites
had their heads shaved. Isis married Osiris, who was killed by his brother
Typhon, and his body thrown into a well, where Isis and her son Anubis,
by the assistance of dogs, found it. Osiris was thenceforth deified under
the form of an ox, and called Apis: Anubis, under the form of a dog.
(Hence Virg., Æn., viii., 698, "Latrator Anubis.") An ox, therefore,
with particular marks (vid. Strab., xvii.; Herod., iii., 28), was kept in
great state, which Osiris was supposed to animate; but when it had reached
a certain age (non est fas eum certos vitæ excedere annos, Plin., viii.,
46), it was drowned in a well (mersum in sacerdotum fonte enecant) with
much ceremonious sorrow, and the priests, attended by an immense concourse
of people, dispersed themselves over the country, wailing and lamenting,
in quest of another with the prescribed marks (quæsituri luctu
alium quem substituant; et donec invenerint mærent, derasis etiam capitibus.
Plin., ii., 3). When they had found one, their lamentations
were exchanged for songs of joy and shouts of εὑρήκαμεν (cf. viii., 29,
Exclamare libet populus quod clamat Osiri invento), and the ox was led
back to the shrine of his predecessor. These gloomy processions lasted
some days; and generally during these (or nine days at least) women
abstained from intercourse with their husbands. These rites were introduced
at Rome, the chief priest personating Anubis, and wearing a dog's
head. Hence <em>derisor</em>. Cf. xv., 8, "Oppida tota canem venerantur."</p></div>

Equestris, or Consus. Hence the dolphins on the columns in the
Circus Maximus. The circus was divided along the middle by the Spina,
at each extremity of which stood three pillars (metæ) round which the
chariots turned: along this spine were seven movable towers or obelisks,
called from their oval form ova, or phalæ; one was taken down at the
end of each course. There were four factions in the circus, Blue, Green
(xi., 196). White, and Red, xii., 114; to which Domitian added the Golden
and the Purple. Suet., Domit., 7. The egg was the badge of the
Green faction (which was the general favorite), the dolphin of the Blue or
sea party. For the form of these, see the Florentine gem in Milman's
Horace, p. 3. Böttiger has a curious theory, that the four colors symbolize
the four elements, the green being the earth. The circus was the
resort of prostitutes (iii., 65) and itinerant fortune-tellers. (Hence "<em>fallax</em>,"
Hor., i., Sat., vi., 113.) Cf. Suet., Jul., 39, and Claud., 21.</p></div>

<h3>SATIRE VII.</h3>

<p>All our hope and inducement to study<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> rests on Cæsar<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> alone.
For he alone casts a favoring eye<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> on the Muses, who in our
days are in a forlorn state. When poets, now become famous
and men of renown, would fain try and hire a little bath at
Gabii, or a public oven at Rome. While others, again, would
esteem it neither shocking nor degrading to turn public
criers: since Clio herself, if starving, would quit the vales of
Aganippe, and emigrate to courts.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> For if not a single
farthing is offered you in the Pierian shades, be content with
the name and calling of Machæra:<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and sooner sell what the
auction duly set<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> sells to those that stand around; wine-flagons,
trivets, book-cases, chests; the "Alcyone" of Paccius,
or the "Thebes" and "Tereus" of Faustus. This is preferable
to asserting before the judge that you are a witness of
what you never did see.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Even though Asiatic,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and Cappadocian,
and Bithynian knights stoop to this: fellows whom
Gallo-Græcia transports hither with chalked feet.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Hereafter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>however, no one will be compelled to submit to an employment
derogatory to his studies, who unites loftiness of
expression to tuneful numbers, and has chewed the bay.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Set
vigorously to work then, young men! The kindness<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> of the
emperor is looking all around, and stimulates your exertions,
while he is seeking worthy objects of his patronage. If you
think that from any other quarter you may look for encouragement
in your pursuits, and with that view fill the parchment
of your yellow<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> tablet; call with all speed for a fagot, and
make a present of all your compositions, Telesinus, to Venus'
husband:<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> or lock them up, and let the bookworm<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> bore them
through as they lie stowed away. Destroy your pens, poor
wretch! Blot out your battles that have lost you your nights'
rest, you that write sublime poetry in your narrow garret,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
that you may come forth worthy of an ivy-crown and meagre
image. You have nothing farther to hope for. The stingy
patron of our days has learned only to admire and praise the
eloquent as boys do Juno's peacock.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> But your prime of life
is ebbing away; that is able to bear the fatigue of the sea,
the helmet, or the spade. Then weariness creeps over the
spirits: and an old age, that is indeed learned but in rags,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
curses itself and the Muses that it courted. Now learn the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>devices of the great man you pay court to, to avoid laying
out any money upon you: quitting the temple of the Muses,
and Apollo, he composes verses himself, and only yields the
palm to Homer himself on the score of his priority by a thousand
years. But if inflamed by the charms of fame you recite
your poetry, he kindly lends you a dirty mansion, and places
at your service one that has been long barred up, whose front
gate emulates those of a city in a state of siege. He knows
how to place his freedmen in seats at the farther end of the
audience, and how to arrange his clients who are to cheer
you lustily.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> None of these great lords will give you as much
as would pay for the benches,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> or the seats that rise one above
another on the platform you have to hire; or your orchestra
of chairs, which must be returned when your recitation is
over. Yet still we ply our tasks, and draw furrows in the
profitless dust, and keep turning up the sea-shore with sterile
plow. For even if you try to abandon the pursuit, the
long habit<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> of indulging in this vain-glorious trifling,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> holds
you fast in its fetters. An inveterate itch of writing, now
incurable, clings to many, and grows old in their distempered
body. But the poet that is above his fellows, whose vein is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>not that of the common herd; that is wont to spin out no
stale or vulgar subject, and stamps no hackneyed verse from
a die that all may use; such an one as I can not embody in
words, and can only feel in my soul, is the offspring of a mind
free from solicitude, exempt from all that can embitter life,
that courts the quiet of the woods, and loves to drink the
fountains of the Aonides. Nor can it be that poverty should
sing in the Pierian cave, or handle the thyrsus, if forced to
sobriety, and lacking that vile pelf the body needs both day
and night. Well plied with food and wine is Horace when
<em>he</em> shouts out his Evoe!<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> What scope is there for fancy, save
when our breasts are harassed by no thoughts but verse alone;
and are hurried along<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> under the influence of the lords of
Cirrha and Nysa, admitting of no divided<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> solicitude. It is
the privilege of an exalted soul, and not of one bewildered
how to get enough to buy a blanket, to gaze on chariots and
horses and the forms of divinities, and in what dread shapes
Erinnys<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> appalls the Rutulian. For had Virgil lacked a slave
and comfortable lodging, all the serpents would have vanished
from Alecto's hair: his trumpet, starved to silence, would
have blazed no note of terror. Is it fair to expect that
Rubrenus Lappa should not fall short of the buskin of the
ancients, while his Atreus<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> forces him to pawn his very
sauceboats and his cloak?</p>

<p>Poor Numitor is so unfortunate as to have nothing he can
afford to send his protégé! Yet he can find something to give
Quintilla&mdash;he managed to pay for a tame lion, that must have
pounds of flesh to feed him. No doubt the huge beast is kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>at far less expense; and a poet's stomach is far more capacious!
Let Lucan recline at his ease in his gardens among
his marble statues, satisfied with fame alone. But to poor
Serranus, and starving Saleius, of what avail will glory be,
however great, if it be glory only? All flock in crowds to
hear his sweet voice, and the tuneful strains of the Thebais,
when Statius<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> has gladdened the city, and fixed the day for
reciting it. So great is the charm with which he captivates
their souls; such the eager delight with which he is listened
to by the multitude. But when the very benches are broken
down by the ecstasies with which his verses are applauded, he
may starve, unless he sells<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> his unpublished "Agave"<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> to Paris.
It is he that bestows on many the honors due to military
service, and encircles the fingers of poets with the ring that
marks their six months' command.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> What nobles will not
give, a player will! And dost thou, then, still pay court to
the Camerini and Bareæ, and the spacious halls of nobles? It
is "Pelopea" that makes prefects, "Philomela" tribunes.
Yet envy not the bard whom the stage maintains. Who is
your Mæcenas now, or Proculeius, or Fabius? Who will act
Cotta's part again, or be a second Lentulus? In those days
talent had its meet reward: then it was profitable to many to
become pale, and abstain from wine<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> the whole of December.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Your toil, forsooth, ye writers of histories! is more profitable,
it requires more time and more oil. For regardless of
all limit, it rises to the thousandth page; and grows in bulk,
expensive from the mass of paper used. This the vast press
of matter requires, and the laws of composition. Yet what
is the crop that springs from it? what the profit from the soil
upturned? Who will give an historian as much as he would
a notary?<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> "But they are an idle race, that delight in sofas
and the cool shade." Well, tell me then, what do the services
rendered their fellow-citizens, and their briefs they carry about
with them in a big bundle, bring in to the lawyers? Even
of themselves they talk grandly enough, but especially when
their creditor is one of their hearers; or if one still more
pressing nudges their side, that comes with his great account-book
to sue for a doubtful debt. Then the hollow bellows of
their lungs breathe forth amazing lies; they foam at the mouth
till their breast is covered. But if you like to calculate the
actual harvest they reap, set in one scale the estate of a hundred
lawyers, and you may balance it on the other side with
the single fortune of Lacerna, the charioteer of the Red.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>The chiefs have taken their seats!<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> You, like Ajax, rise
with pallid cheek, and plead in behalf of liberty that has been

your strained lungs, poor wretch! that, when exhausted, the
green palm-branches<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> may be affixed to crown your staircase
with honor! Yet what is the reward of your eloquence?
A rusty ham, or a dish of sprats; or some shriveled onions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>the monthly provender of the Africans;<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> or wine brought

we pleaded better than he. For he has in his court-yard
a chariot of bronze with four tall horses<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> yoked to it; and
he himself, seated on his fierce charger, brandishes aloft his
bending spear, and meditates battles with his one eye closed.
So it is that Pedo gets involved, Matho fails. This is the
end of Tongillus, who usually bathes with a huge rhinoceros'
horn of oil, and annoys the baths with his draggled train; and
weighs heavily in his ponderous sedan on his sturdy Median
slaves, as he presses through the forum to bid for<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> slaves, and

purple with its Tyrian tissue that gets him credit. And yet
this answers their purpose. It is the purple robe that gets
the lawyer custom&mdash;his violet cloaks that attract clients. It
suits their interest to live with all the bustle and outward
show of an income greater then they really have. But prodigal
Rome observes no bounds to her extravagance. If the
old orators were to come to life again, no one now would give
even Cicero himself two hundred sesterces, unless a huge ring
sparkled on his finger. This is the first point he that goes to
law looks to&mdash;whether you have eight slaves, ten attendants,
a sedan to follow you, and friends in toga to go before. Paulus,
consequently, used to plead in a sardonyx, hired for the
occasion: and hence it was that Cossus' fees were higher than
those of Basilus. Eloquence is a rare quality in a threadbare
coat!</p>

<p>When is Basilus allowed to produce in court a weeping
mother? Who could endure Basilus, however well he were
to plead? Let Gaul become your home, or better still that
foster-nurse of pleaders, Africa, if you are determined to let
your tongue for hire.</p>

<p>Do you teach declamation? Oh what a heart of steel must
Vectius have, when his numerous class kills cruel tyrants!
For all that the boy has just conned over at his seat, he will
then stand up and spout&mdash;the same stale theme in the same
sing-song. It is the reproduction of the cabbage<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> that wears
out the master's life. What is the plea to be urged: what
the character of the cause; where the main point of the case
hinges; what shafts may issue from the opposing party;&mdash;this
all are anxious to know; but not one is anxious to pay!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
"<em>Pay</em> do you ask for? why, what do I know?" The blame,
forsooth, is laid at the teacher's door, because there is not a
spark of energy in the breast of this scion of Arcadia,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> who
dins his awful Hannibal into my ears regularly every sixth
day. Whatever the theme be that is to be the subject of his
deliberation; whether he shall march at once from Cannæ on
Rome; or whether, rendered circumspect after the storms
and thunderbolts, he shall lead his cohorts, drenched with the
tempest, by a circuitous route. Bargain<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> for any sum you
please, and I will at once place it in your hands, on condition
that his father should hear him his lesson as often as I have
to do it! But six or more sophists are all giving tongue at
once; and, debating in good earnest, have abandoned all fictitious
declamations about the ravisher. No more is heard
of the poison infused, or the vile ungrateful husband,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> or the
drugs that can restore the aged blind to youth. He therefore
that quits the shadowy conflicts of rhetoric for the arena of
real debate, will superannuate himself, if my advice has any
weight with him, and enter on a different path of life; that
he may not lose even the paltry sum that will purchase the
miserable ticket<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> for corn. Since this is the most splendid
reward you can expect. Just inquire what Chrysogonus
receives, or Pollio, for teaching the sons of these fine gentlemen,
and going into all the details<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> of Theodorus' treatise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The baths will cost six hundred sestertia, and the colonnade
still more, in which the great man rides whenever it
rains. Is he to wait, forsooth, for fair weather? or bespatter
his horses with fresh mud? Nay, far better here! for here
the mule's hoof shines unsullied.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> On the other side must
rise a spacious dining-room, supported on stately columns of
Numidian marble, and catch the cool<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> sun. However much
the house may have cost, he will have besides an artiste who
can arrange his table scientifically; another, who can season
made-dishes. Yet amid all this lavish expenditure, two poor
sestertia will be deemed an ample remuneration for Quintilian.
Nothing will cost a father less than his son's education.</p>

<p>"Then where did Quintilian get the money to pay for so
many estates?" Pass by the instances of good fortune that
are but rare indeed. It is good <em>luck</em> that makes a man handsome
and active; good luck that makes him wise, and noble,
and well-bred, and attaches the crescent<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> of the senator to his
black shoe. Good luck too that makes him the best of orators
and debaters, and, though he has a vile cold, sing well! For
it makes all the difference what planets welcome you when
you first begin to utter your infant cry, and are still red from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>your mother. If fortune so wills it, you will become consul
instead of rhetorician; or, if she will, instead of rhetorician,
consul! What was Ventidius<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> or Tullius aught else than a
lucky planet, and the strange potency of hidden fate? Fate,
that gives kingdoms to slaves, and triumphs to captives.
Yes! Quintilian was indeed lucky, but he is a greater rarity
even than a white crow. But many a man has repented of
this fruitless and barren employment, as the sad end of
Thrasymachus<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> proves, and that of Secundus Carrinas.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> And
you, too, Athens, were witness to the poverty of him on whom
you had the heart to bestow nothing save the hemlock that
chilled<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> his life-blood!</p>

<p>Light be the earth, ye gods!<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and void of weight, that
presses on our grandsires' shades, and round their urn bloom
fragrant crocus and eternal spring, who maintained that a
tutor should hold the place and honor of a revered parent.
Achilles sang on his paternal hills, in terror of the lash, though
now grown up; and yet in whom even then would not the
tail of his master, the harper, provoke a smile? But now
Rufus<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> and others are beaten each by their own pupils; Rufus!
who so often called Cicero "the Allobrogian!" Who casts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>into Enceladus'<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> lap, or that of the learned Palæmon,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> as much
as their grammarian labors have merited! And yet even
from the wretched sum, however small (and it is smaller than
the rhetorician's pay), Acænonoëtus, his pupil's pedagogue,
first takes his slice; and then the steward who pays you deducts
his fragment. Dispute it not, Palæmon! and suffer
some abatement to be made, just as the peddler does that deals
in winter rugs and snow-white sheetings.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Only let not all be
lost,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> for which you have sat from the midnight hour, when no
smith would sit, nor even he that teaches how to draw out
wool with the oblique iron. Lose not your whole reward for
having smelled as many lamps as there were boys standing
round you; while Horace was altogether discolored, and the
foul smut clave to the well-thumbed Maro. Yet rare too is
the pay that does not require enforcing by the Tribune's court.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>But do you, parents, impose severe exactions on him that
is to teach your boys; that he be perfect in the rules of
grammar for each word&mdash;read all histories<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>&mdash;know all authors
as well as his own finger-ends; that if questioned at hazard,
while on his way to the Thermæ or the baths of Phœbus, he
should be able to tell the name of Anchises' nurse,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and the
name and native land of the step-mother of Anchemolus&mdash;tell
off-hand how many years Acestes lived&mdash;how many flagons of
wine the Sicilian king gave to the Phrygians. Require of him
that he mould their youthful morals as one models a face in
wax. Require of him that he be the reverend father of the
company, and check every approach to immorality.</p>

hands, so many little twinkling eyes. "This," says the father,

of a friend, "Hunc rogo semestri tribunatu splendidiorem facias." There
are divers other interpretations, but this appears the simplest and most
probable. To confound it with the "æstivum aurum" (i., 28), is a palpable
absurdity.</p></div>

windy rampart.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> "You are the lower orders!" he says;
"the very dregs of our populace! Not a man of you could

may you live!<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> and long revel in the joys of such a descent!
Yet from the lowest of this common herd you will find one
that is indeed an eloquent Roman. It is he that usually pleads
the cause of the ignorant noble.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> From the toga'd crowd will
come one that can solve the knotty points of law, and the
enigmas of the statutes. He it is that in his prime carves out
his fortune with his sword, and goes to Euphrates, and the
legions that keep guard over the conquered Batavi. While
you are nothing but a Cecropid, and most like the shapeless
pillar crowned with Hermes' head. Since in no other point
of difference have you the advantage save in this&mdash;that his
head is of marble,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and your image is endowed with life! Tell
me, descendant of the Teucri, who considers dumb animals
highly bred, unless strong and courageous? Surely it is on
this score we praise the fleet horse&mdash;to grace whose speed full
many a palm glows,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and Victory, in the circus hoarse with
shouting, stands exulting by. He is the steed of fame, from
whatever pasture he comes, whose speed is brilliantly before
the others, and whose dust is first on the plain. But
the brood of Corytha, and Hirpinus' stock, are put up for sale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>if victory sit but seldom on their yoke. In their case no regard
is had to their pedigree&mdash;their dead sires win them no favor&mdash;they
are forced to change their owners for paltry prices,
and draw wagons with galled withers, if slow of foot, and only
fit to turn Nepos'<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> mill. Therefore that we may admire <em>you</em>,
and not <em>yours</em>, first achieve some noble act<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> that I may inscribe
on your statue's base, besides those honors that we pay, and

<p>Enough has been said to the youth whom common report
represents to us as haughty and puffed up from his relationship
to Nero.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> For in that rank of life the courtesies<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> of good
breeding are commonly rare enough. But you, Ponticus, I
would not have <em>you</em> valued for your ancestors' renown; so as
to contribute nothing yourself to deserve the praise of posterity.
It is wretched work building on another's fame; lest
the whole pile crumble into ruins when the pillars that held
it up are withdrawn. The vine that trails along the ground,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
sighs for its widowed elms in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Prove yourself a good soldier, a faithful guardian, an incorruptible
judge. If ever you shall be summoned as a witness
in a doubtful and uncertain cause, though Phalaris himself
command you to turn liar, and dictate the perjuries with his
bull placed before your eyes, deem it to be the summit of impiety<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
to prefer existence to honor,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> and for the sake of life to

though he still sup on a hundred Gauran<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> oysters, and plunge

<p>When your long-expected province shall at length receive
you for its ruler, set a bound to your passion, put a curb on
your avarice. Have pity on our allies whom we have brought
to poverty. You see the very marrow drained from the
empty bones of kings. Have respect to what the laws prescribe,
the senate enjoins. Remember what great rewards
await the good, with how just a stroke ruin lighted on Capito<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
and Numitor, those pirates of the Cilicians, when the senate
fulminated its decrees against them. But what avails their
condemnation, when Pansa plunders you of all that Natta
left? Look out for an auctioneer to sell your tattered clothes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Chærippus, and then hold your tongue! It is sheer madness
to lose, when all is gone, even Charon's fee.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>There were not the same lamentations of yore, nor was the
wound inflicted on our allies by pillage as great as it is now,
while they were still flourishing, and but recently conquered.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
Then every house was full, and a huge pile of money stood
heaped up, cloaks from Sparta, purple robes from Cos, and
along with pictures by Parrhasius, and statues by Myro, the
ivory of Phidias seemed instinct with life;<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and many a work
from Polycletus' hand in every house; few were the tables
that could not show a cup of Mentor's chasing. Then came
Dolabella,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> and then Antony, then the sacrilegious Verres;<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
they brought home in their tall<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> ships the spoils they dared
not show, and more<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> triumphs from peace than were ever
won from war. Now our allies have but few yokes of oxen,
a small stock of brood-mares, and the patriarch<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> of the herd
will be harried from the pasture they have already taken possession
of. Then the very Lares themselves, if there is any
statue worth looking at, if any little shrine still holds its single
god. For this, since it is the best they have, is the highest
prize they can seize upon.</p>

<p>You may perhaps despise the Rhodians unfit for war, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>essenced Corinth: and well you may! How can a resin-smeared<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
youth, and the depilated legs of a whole nation, retaliate
upon you. You must keep clear of rugged Spain, the
Gallic car,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and the Illyrian coast. Spare too those reapers<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
that overstock the city, and give it leisure for the circus<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> and
the stage. Yet what rewards to repay so atrocious a crime
could you carry off from thence, since Marius<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> has so lately
plundered the impoverished Africans even of their very girdles?<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>You must be especially cautious lest a deep injury be inflicted
on those who are bold as well as wretched. Though
you may strip them of all the gold and silver they possess,
you will yet leave them shield and sword, and javelin and
helm. Plundered of all, they yet have <em>arms</em> to spare!</p>

<p>What I have just set forth is no opinion of my own. Believe
that I am reciting to you a leaf of the sibyl, that can not
lie. If your retinue are men of spotless life, if no favorite
youth<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> barters your judgments for gold, if your wife<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> is clear
from all stain of guilt, and does not prepare to go through the
district courts,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> and all the towns of your province, ready, like

you may, if you please, reckon your descent from Picus;
and if high-sounding names are your fancy, place the whole
army of Titans among your ancestors, or even Prometheus<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
himself. Adopt a founder of your line from any book you
please. But if ambition and lust hurry you away headlong,
if you break your rods<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> on the bloody backs of the allies, if
your delight is in axes blunted by the victor worn out with
using them&mdash;then the nobility of your sires themselves begins
to rise<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> in judgment against you, and hold forth a torch to
blaze upon your shameful deeds.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Every act of moral turpitude
incurs more glaring reprobation in exact proportion to
the rank of him that commits it. Why vaunt your pedigree
to me? you, that are wont to put your name to forged deeds
in the very temples<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> which your grandsire built, before your
very fathers' triumphal statues! or, an adulterer that dares
not face the day, you veil your brows concealed beneath a
Santon<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> cowl. The bloated Damasippus is whirled in his
rapid car past the ashes and bones of his ancestors&mdash;and with
his own hands, yes! though consul! with his own hands locks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>his wheel with the frequent drag-chain.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> It is, indeed, at
night. But still the moon sees him! The stars strain on
him their attesting eyes.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> When the period of his magistracy
is closed, Damasippus<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> will take whip in hand in the broad
glare of day, and never dread meeting his friend now grown
old, and will be the first to give him the coachman's salute, and
untie the trusses and pour the barley<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> before his weary steeds
himself. Meantime, even while according to Numa's ancient
rites he sacrifices the woolly victim and the stalwart bull before
Jove's altar, he swears by Epona<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> alone, and the faces
daubed over the stinking stalls. But when he is pleased to
repeat his visits to the taverns open all night long, the Syrophœnician,
reeking with his assiduous perfume,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> runs to meet
him (the Syrophœnician that dwells at the Idumæan<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> gate),
with all the studied courtesy of a host, he salutes him as "lord"<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
and "king;" and Cyane, with gown tucked up, with her bottle
for sale. One who wishes to palliate his crimes will say to
me, "Well; we did so too when we were young!" Granted.
But surely you left off, and did not indulge in your folly beyond
that period. Let what you basely dare be ever brief!
There are some faults that should be shorn away with our
first beard. Make all reasonable allowance for boys. But
Damasippus frequents those debauches of the bagnios, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>the painted signs,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> when of ripe age for war, for guarding
Armenia<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and Syria's rivers, and the Rhine or Danube. His
time of life qualifies him to guard the emperor's person. Send
then to Ostia!<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Cæsar&mdash;send! But look for your general in
some great tavern. You will find him reclining with some
common cut-throat; in a medley of sailors, and thieves, and
runaway slaves; among executioners and cheap coffin-makers,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
and the now silent drums of the priest of Cybele,
lying drunk on his back.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> There there is equal liberty for all&mdash;cups
in common&mdash;nor different couch for any, or table set
aloof from the herd. What would you do, Ponticus, were it
your lot to have a slave of such a character? Why surely
you would dispatch him to the Lucanian or Tuscan bridewells.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
But you, ye Trojugenæ! find excuses for yourselves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>what would disgrace a cobbler<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> will be becoming in a Volesus
or Brutus!</p>

<p>What if we never produce examples so foul and shameful,
that worse do not yet remain behind! When all your wealth
was squandered, Damasippus, you let your voice for hire<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> to
the stage,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> to act the noisy Phasma<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> of Catullus. Velox Lentulas
acted Laureolus, and creditably too. In my judgment
he deserved crucifying in earnest. Nor yet can you acquit
the people themselves from blame. The brows of the people
are too hardened that sit<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> spectators of the buffooneries of the
patricians, listen to the Fabii with naked feet, and laugh at
the slaps on the faces of the Mamerci. What matters it at
what price they sell their lives: they sell them at no tyrant's
compulsion,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> [nor hesitate<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> to do it even at the games of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>prætor seated on high.] Yet imagine the gladiator's sword<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> on
one side, the stage on the other. Which is the better alternative?
Has any one so slavish a dread of death as to become
the jealous lover of Thymele,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> the colleague of the heavy
Corinthus? Yet it is nothing to be wondered at, if the
emperor turn harper, that the nobleman should turn actor.
To crown all this, what is left but the amphitheatre?<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> And
this disgrace of the city you have as well&mdash;Gracchus<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> not
fighting equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for
he condemns&mdash;yes, condemns and hates such an equipment).
Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he
wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets
suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered
face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized,
flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic,<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters
in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore the disgrace,
which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to
fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound. Were the
people allowed the uncontrolled exercise of their votes, who
could be found so abandoned as to hesitate to prefer Seneca<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
to Nero? For whose punishment there should have been prepared
not a single ape<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> only, or one snake or sack.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> "His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>crime is matched by that of Orestes!"<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> But it is the motive
cause that gives the quality to the act. Since he, at the instigation
of the gods themselves, was the avenger of his father
butchered in his cups. But he neither imbrued his hands in
Electra's blood, or that of his Spartan wife; he mixed no
aconite for his relations. Orestes never sang on the stage; he
never wrote "Troïcs." What, blacker crime was there for
Virginius'<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> arms to avenge, or Galba leagued with Vindex?
In all his tyranny, cruel and bloody as it was, what exploit did
Nero<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> achieve? These are the works, these the accomplishments
of a high-born prince&mdash;delighting to prostitute<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> his
rank by disgraceful dancing on a foreign stage, and earn the
parsley of the Grecian crown. Array the statues of your ancestors
in the trophies of your voice. At Domitius'<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> feet lay
the long train of Thyestes, or Antigone, or Menalippe's mask,

<p>What could any one find more noble than thy birth, Catiline,

been the sons of the Braccati,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> or descendants of the Senones.

your bands. He whom you sneer at as a novus<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> homo from
Arpinum, of humble birth, and but lately made a municipal
knight at Rome, disposes every where his armed guards to
protect the terrified people, and exerts himself in every quarter.
Therefore the peaceful toga, within the walls, bestowed
on him such honors and renown as not even Octavius bore
away from Leucas<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> or the plains of Thessaly, with sword reeking
with unintermitted slaughter. But Rome owned him for
a parent. Rome, when unfettered,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> hailed Cicero as father of
his father-land.</p>

<p>Another native of Arpinum was wont to ask for his wages
when wearied with another's plow on the Volscian hills.
After that, he had the knotted vine-stick<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> broken about his
head, if he lazily fortified the camp with sluggard axe. Yet
<em>he</em> braved the Cimbri, and the greatest perils of the state, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>alone protected the city in her alarm. And therefore when
the ravens, that had never lighted on bigger carcasses,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> flocked
to the slaughtered heaps of Cimbrians slain, his nobly-born

<p>The souls of the Decii were plebeian, their very names
plebeian. Yet these are deemed by the infernal deities and
mother Earth a fair equivalent for the whole legions, and all
the forces of the allies, and all the flower of Latium. For
the Decii<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> were more highly valued by <em>them</em> than all they died
to save!</p>

<p>It was one born from a slave<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> that won the robe and diadem
and fasces of Quirinus, that last of good kings! They
that were for loosening the bolts of the gates betrayed to the
exiled tyrants, were the sons of the consul himself! men from
whom we might have looked for some glorious achievement
in behalf of liberty when in peril; some act that Mucius' self,
or Cocles, might admire; and the maiden that swam across<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
the Tiber, then the limit of our empire. He that divulged
to the fathers the secret treachery was a slave,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> afterward to
be mourned for by all the Roman matrons: while they suffer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>the well-earned punishment of the scourge, and the axe,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> then
first used by Rome since she became republican.</p>

<p>I had rather that Thersites<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> were your sire, provided you
resembled Æacides and could wield the arms of Vulcan, than
that Achilles should beget you to be a match to Thersites.</p>

<p>And yet, however far you go back, however far you trace
your name, you do but derive your descent from the infamous
sanctuary.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> That first of your ancestors, whoever he was,

<h3>SATIRE IX.</h3>

<p>I should like to know, Nævolus,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> why you so often meet
me with clouded brow forlorn, like Marsyas after his defeat.
What have you to do with such a face as Ravola had when
detected with his Rhodope?<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> We give a slave a box on the
ear, if he licks the pastry. Why! Crepereius Pollio<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> had not
a more woe-begone face than yours; he that went about
ready to pay three times the ordinary interest, and could find
none fools enough to trust him. Where do so many wrinkles
come from all of a sudden? Why, surely before, contented
with little, you used to live like a gentleman's gentleman<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>witty boon-companion with your biting jest, and sharp at
repartees that savor of town-life!</p>

<p>Now all is the reverse; your looks are dejected; your
tangled hair bristles like a thicket;<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> there is none of that sleekness
over your whole skin, such as the Bruttian plaster of hot
pitch used to give you; but your legs are neglected and rank
with a shrubbery of hair. What means this emaciated form,
like that of some old invalid parched this many a day with
quartan ague and fever that has made his limbs its home?
You may detect<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> the anguish of the mind that lurks in the
sickly body&mdash;and discover its joys also. For the face, the
index of the mind, takes its complexion from each. You
seem, therefore, to have changed your course of life, and to
run counter to your former habits. For, but lately, as I well
remember, you used to haunt the temple of Isis,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and the
statue of Ganymede in the temple of Peace,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> and the secret
palaces of the imported mother<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> of the gods; ay, and Ceres
too (for what temple is there in which you may not find a
woman)&mdash;a more notorious adulterer even than Aufidius, and
under the rose, not confining your attentions to the wives!</p>

<p>"Yes: even this way of life is profitable to many. But I
never made it worth my while: we do occasionally get greasy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>cloaks, that serve to save our toga, of coarse texture and indifferent
dye, the clumsy workmanship of some French
weaver's lay; or a small piece of silver of inferior metal.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
The Fates control the destinies of men: nay, there is fate
even in those very parts which the lap of the toga conceals
from view. For if the stars are unpropitious, your manly
powers, remaining unknown, will profit you nothing, even
though the liquorish Virro has seen you stripped, and seductive
billets-doux, closely following each other, are forever assailing
you: for such a fellow as he even entices others to sin.
Yet, what monster can be worse, than one miserly as well as
effeminate?"<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> "I gave you so much, then so much, and then
soon after you had more!" He reckons up and still acts the
wanton. "Let us settle our accounts! Send for the slaves
with my account-book! Reckon up five thousand sesterces
in all! Then count up your services!" Are then my duties
so light, and so little against the grain? Far less wretched
will be the poor slave that digs the great man's land! But
you, forsooth, thought yourself delicate, and young, and beautiful!
fit to be a cup-bearer in heaven!</p>

<p>Will you ever bestow favors on a humble dependent, or be
generous to one that pays you court, when you grudge even
the money you spend on your unnatural<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> gratifications?
See the fellow! to whom you are to send a present of a green
parasol and large amber<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> bowls, as often as his birthday comes
round, or rainy spring begins; or pillowed on his cushioned
sofa, he fingers presents set apart for the female Kalends!<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell me, you sparrow, for whom it is you are keeping so many
hills, so many Apulian<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> farms, so many kites wearied in flying
across your pastures? Your Trifoline estate<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> enriches you
with its fruitful vines; and the hill that looks down<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> on
Cumæ, and caverned Gaurus. Who seals up more<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> casks of
wine that will bear long keeping? How great a matter
would it be to present the loins of your client, worn out in
your service, with a few acres? Would yon rustic child,
with his mother, and her hovel,<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> and his playmate cur, more
justly become the inheritance of your cymbal-beating friend?
"You are a most importunate beggar!" he says: But <em>Rent</em>
cries out to me "Beg!" My only slave calls on me to beg!
loudly as Polyphemus<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> with his one broad eye, by which the
crafty Ulysses made his escape. I shall be compelled to buy
a second, for this one is not enough for me; both must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>fed. What shall I do in mid-winter? When the chill north
wind whistles in December,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> what shall I say, pray, to my
poor slaves' naked feet and shoulders? "Courage,<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> my boys!
and wait for the grasshoppers?" But however you may dissemble
and pass by all other matters, at how much do you
estimate it, that had I not been your devoted client your wife
would still remain a maid? At all events, you know all about
those services, how hard you begged, how much you promised!
Often when your young wife was eloping, I caught her in
my embrace. She had actually torn<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> the marriage contract,
and was on the point of signing a new one. It was with difficulty
that I set this matter right by a whole night's work,
while you stood whimpering outside the door. I appeal to the
bed as my witness! nay, to yourself, who heard the noise, and
the lady's cries! In many a house, when the marriage bonds
were growing feeble and beginning to give way, and were almost
severed, an adulterer has set all matters right. However
you may shift your ground, whatever services you may
reckon first or last, is it indeed no obligation, ungrateful and
perfidious man! is it none, that you have an infant son or
daughter born to you through me? For you bring them up
as yours! and plume yourself on inserting at intervals in the
public registers<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> these evidences of your virility! Hang garlands<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
on your doors! You are now a father! I have given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>you what you may cast in slander's teeth! You have a father's
privileges; through me you may inherit a legacy, yes,
the whole sum<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> left to you, not to mention some pleasant
windfall!<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Besides, many other advantages will be added to
these windfalls, if I make the number complete and add a
third!"</p>

<p>"Your ground of complaint is just indeed, Nævolus; what
does he allege in answer?"</p>

<p>"He casts me off, and looks out for some other two-legged
ass to serve his turn! But remember that these secrets are
intrusted to you alone; keep them to yourself, therefore, buried
in the silence of your own breast; for one of these pumice-smoothed<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
fellows is a deadly thing if he becomes your
enemy. He that intrusted his secret to me but the other day,
now is furious, and detests me just as though I had divulged
all I know. He does not hesitate to use his dagger, to break
my skull with a bludgeon, or place a firebrand at my doors:<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
and deem it no light or contemptible matter that to men of
his wealth the price of poison is never too costly. Therefore
you must keep my secrets as religiously as the court of Mars
at Athens."</p>

<p>"Oh! Corydon,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> poor simple Corydon! Do you think
aught that a rich man does can be secret? Even though his
slaves should hold their tongues, his cattle will tell the tale;
and his dogs, and door-posts, and marble statues! Close the
shutters, cover all the chinks with tapestry, fasten the doors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>remove every light from the chamber,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> let each one keep his
counsel, let not a soul lie near. Yet what he does at the
second cock-crow,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> the next tavern-keeper will know before
dawn of day; and will hear as well all the fabrications of his
steward, cooks, and carvers.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> For what charge do they scruple
to concoct against their masters, as often as they revenge
themselves for their strappings<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> by the lies they forge? Nor
will there be wanting one to hunt you out against your will
in the public thoroughfares, and pour his drunken tale into
your miserable ears. Therefore ask them what you just now
begged of me! They hold their tongues! Why they would
rather blaze abroad a secret than drink as much Falernian
(all the sweeter because stolen) as Saufeia<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> used to drink,
when sacrificing<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> for the people!</p>

<p>"One should lead an upright life for very many reasons;
but especially for this&mdash;that you may be able to despise your
servants' tongues. For bad as your slave may be, his tongue
is the worst part about him. Yet far worse still is he that
places himself in the power of those whose body and soul he
keeps together with his own bread and his own money.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, the advice you have just given me to enable me to
laugh to scorn my servants' tongues is very good, but too
general. Now, what do you advise in my particular case,
after the loss of my time and the disappointment of my hopes?
For the short-lived bloom<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and contracted span of a brief and
wretched life is fast fleeting away! While we are drinking,<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
and calling for garlands, and perfumes, and women, old age
steals on us unperceived! Do not be alarmed! So long as
these seven hills stand fast you will never lack a pathic friend.
Those effeminates, who scratch their heads with one finger,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
will flock from all quarters to these hills, in carriages and
ships. You have still another and a better hope in store.
All you have to do is to chew eringo vigorously." "Tell

They contained, besides, records of marriages, divorces, deaths, and other
occurrences of the year, and were therefore of great service to historians,

<h3>SATIRE X.</h3>

<p>In all the regions which extend from Gades<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> even to the
farthest east and Ganges, there are but few that can discriminate
between real blessings and those that are widely different,
all the mist<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> of error being removed. For what is there that
we either fear or wish for, as reason would direct? What is
there that you enter on under such favorable auspices, that
you do not repent of your undertaking, and the accomplishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>of your wish? The too easy gods have overthrown<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
whole families by granting their owners' prayers. Our prayers
are put up for what will injure us in peace and injure us in
war. To many the copious fluency<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> of speech, and their very
eloquence, is fatal. It was owing to his strength<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> and wondrous
muscle, in which he placed his trust, that the Athlete
met his death. But money heaped up with overwhelming
care, and a revenue surpassing all common patrimonies as
much as the whale of Britain<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> exceeds dolphins, causes more
to be strangled. Therefore it was, that in that reign of Terror,
and at Nero's bidding, a whole cohort<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> blockaded Longinus<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
and the spacious gardens of the over-wealthy Seneca,<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
and laid siege to the splendid<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> mansion of the Laterani.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>is but rarely that the soldier pays his visit to a garret. Though
you are conveying ever so few vessels of unembossed silver,
entering on your journey by night, you will dread the bandit's
knife and bludgeon, and tremble at the shadow of a reed as it
quivers in the moonshine.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The traveler with empty<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> pockets
will sing even in the robber's face.</p>

<p>The prayers that are generally the first put up and best
known in all the temples are, that riches,<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> that wealth may increase;
that our chest may be the largest in the whole forum.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
But no aconite is drunk from earthenware. It is time to
dread it when you quaff jeweled cups,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and the ruddy Setine
blazes in the broad gold. And do you not, then, now commend
the fact, that of the two sages,<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> one used to laugh<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> whenever
he had advanced a single step from his threshold; the
other, with sentiments directly contrary, used to weep. But
easy enough to any one is the stern censure of a sneering
laugh: the wonder is how the other's eyes could ever have a
sufficient supply of tears.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Democritus used to shake his sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>with perpetual laughter, though in the cities of those regions
there were no prætextæ, no trabeæ,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> no fasces, no litter, no
tribunal! What, had he seen the prætor<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> standing pre-eminent
in his lofty car, and raised on high in the mid dust of the circus,
dressed in the tunic of Jove, and wearing on his shoulders
the Tyrian hangings of the embroidered toga; and the circlet
of a ponderous crown,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> so heavy that no single neck could endure
the weight:<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> since the official, all in a sweat, supports it,
and, that the consul may not be too elated, the slave rides in
the same car. Then, add the bird that rises from his ivory
sceptre: on one side the trumpeters; on the other, the long
train of attendant clients, that march before him, and the
Quirites, all in white togas, walking by his horses' heads;
men whose friendship he has won by the sportula buried deep
in his chest. Even in those days <em>he</em> found subject for ridicule
in every place where human beings meet, whose wisdom
proves that men of the highest intellect, men that will furnish
noble examples, may be born in the country of wether-sheep,
and in a foggy<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> atmosphere. He used to laugh at the cares
and also the joys of the common herd; sometimes even at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>their tears: while he himself would bid Fortune, when she
frowned, "Go hang!" and point at her his finger<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> in scorn!
Superfluous therefore, or else destructive, are all those objects
of our prayers, for which we think it right to cover the knees
of the gods with waxen tablets.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Power, exposed to great envy, hurls some headlong down
to ruin. The long and splendid list of their titles and
honors sinks<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> into the dust. Down come their statues,<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and
are dragged along with ropes: then the very wheels of the
chariot are smashed by the vigorous stroke of the axe, and
the legs of the innocent<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> horses are demolished. Now the
fires roar! Now that head, once worshiped<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> by the mob,
glows with the bellows and the furnace! Great Sejanus
crackles! Then from that head, second only in the whole
wide world, are made pitchers, basins, frying-pans,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> and platters!
"Crown your doors with bays!<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Lead to Jove's Capitol
a huge and milk-white ox! Sejanus is being dragged
along by the hook! a glorious sight!" Every body is delighted.
"What lips he had! and what a face! If you
believe me, I never could endure this man!" "But what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>was the charge under which he fell! Who was the accuser?
what the information laid? By whose witness did he prove
it?" "Nothing of the sort! a wordy and lengthy epistle
came from Capreæ." "That's enough! I ask no farther. But
how does the mob of Remus behave!" "Why, follow Fortune,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
as mobs always do, and hate him that is condemned?"
That self-same people, had Tuscan Nurscia<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> smiled propitious
on her countryman&mdash;had the old age of the emperor been
crushed while he thought all secure&mdash;would in that very
hour have saluted Sejanus as Augustus. Long ago they have
thrown overboard all anxiety. For that sovereign people
that once gave away military command, consulships, legions,
and every thing, now bridles its desires, and limits its anxious
longings to two things only&mdash;bread, and the games of the circus!
"I hear that many are involved in his fall." "No doubt:
the little furnace<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> is a capacious one; I met my friend Brutidius<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
at the altar of Mars looking a little pale!" "But I
greatly fear that Ajax, being baffled,<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> will wreak fearful vengeance,
as having been inadequately defended. Let us rush
headlong; and, while he still lies on the river-bank, trample
on Cæsar's foe? But take care that our slaves witness the
act! lest any of them should deny it, and drag his master to
trial with a halter round his neck!" Such were the conversations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>then about Sejanus; such the smothered whispers of
the populace? Would <em>you</em> then have the same court paid to
you that Sejanus had? possess as much, bestow on one the
highest curule honors, give another the command of armies,<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
be esteemed the lawful guardian<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> of the prince that lounged
away<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> his days with his herd of Chaldæan astrologers, in the
rock of Capreæ that he made his palace?<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Would you have
centuries and cohorts, and a picked body of cavalry,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> and prætorian
bands at your beck? Why should you not covet these?
Even those who have not the <em>will</em> to kill a man would gladly
have the <em>power</em>. But what brilliant or prosperous fortune is of
sufficient worth that your measure of evils should balance your
good luck? Would you rather put on the prætexta of him
that is being dragged along, or be the magistrate of Fidenæ or
Gabii, and give sentence about false weights,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and break up
scanty measures as the ragged ædile of the deserted Ulubræ?<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>You acknowledge, therefore, that Sejanus did not know what
ought to have been the object of his wishes. For he that
coveted excessive honors, and prayed for excessive wealth,
was but rearing up the multiplied stories of a tower raised on
high, only that the fall might be the deeper,<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> and horrible the
headlong descent of his ruin<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> once accelerated!</p>

<p>What overthrew the Crassi?<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and Pompey and his sons?<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
and him that brought Rome's haughty citizens quailing<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> beneath
his lash? Surely it was the post of highest advancement,
reached by every possible device, and prayers for greatness
heard by gods who showed their malignity in granting
them! Few kings go down without slaughter and wounds
to Ceres' son-in-law. Few tyrants die a bloodless death!</p>

<p>He that as yet pays court to<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Minerva, purchased by a
single <em>as</em>, that is followed by his little slave<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> to take charge of
his diminutive satchel, begins to long, and longs through all
his quinquatrian<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> holidays, for the eloquence and the renown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>of Demosthenes or Cicero. But it was through their eloquence
that both of these orators perished: the copious and
overflowing fount of talent gave over each to destruction; by
talent, was his hand and head cut off! Nor did the Rostra<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
ever reek with the blood of a contemptible pleader.</p>

<p>"O fortunate Rome, whose natal day may date from me
as consul!" He might have scorned the swords of Antony,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
had all he uttered been such trash as this. I had rather
write poems that excite only ridicule, than thee, divine Philippic
of distinguished fame! that art unrolled next to the
first! Cruel was the end that carried him off also whom
Athens used to admire as his words flowed from his lips in a
torrent<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> of eloquence, and he swayed at will the passions of
the crowded theatre. With adverse gods and inauspicious
fate was he born, whom his father, blear-eyed with the grime
of the glowing mass, sent from the coal, and pincers,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and the
sword-forging anvil, and sooty Vulcan,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> to the rhetorician's
school!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The spoils of war, the cuirass fastened to the truncated<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
trophy, the cheek-piece hanging from the battered helm, the
car shorn of its pole, the streamer of the captured galley,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> and
the sad captive on the triumphal arch-top,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> are held to be
goods exceeding all human blessings. For these each general,
Roman, or Greek, or Barbarian, strains as his prize! Full
compensation for his dangers and his toils he sees in these!
So much greater is the thirst after fame than virtue. For
who would embrace<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> virtue herself, if you took away the rewards
of virtue? And yet, ere now, the glory of a few has
been the ruin of their native land; that longing for renown,
and those inscriptions that are to live on the marble that
guards their ashes; and yet to burst asunder this, the mischievous
strength of the barren fig-tree has power enough.
Since even to sepulchres<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> themselves are fates assigned.
Weigh<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> the remains of Hannibal! How many pounds will
you find in that most consummate general! This is the man
whom not even Africa, lashed by the Mauritanian ocean, and
stretching even to the steaming Nile, and then again to the
races of the Æthiopes and their tall<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> elephants, can contain!

Spain is annexed to Carthage's domain. He bounds across
the Pyrenees. Nature opposed in vain the Alps with all
their snows; he cleaves the rocks and rives the mountains
with vinegar.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Now he is lord of Italy! Yet still he presses
on. "Naught is achieved,"<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> he says, "unless we burst
through the gates of Rome with the soldiery of Carthage, and
I plant my standard in the heart of the Suburra!" Oh what
a face!<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and worthy what a picture! when the huge Gætulian
beast bore on his back the one-eyed<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> general! What
then was the issue? Oh glory! This self-made man is conquered,
and flees with headlong haste to exile, and there, a
great and much-to-be-admired client, sits at the palace of the
king, until his Bithynian majesty<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> be pleased to wake! To
that soul, that once shook the very world's base, it is not
sword, nor stone, nor javelin, that shall give the final stroke;
but, that which atoned for Cannæ, and avenged such mighty
carnage,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> a ring! Go then, madman, and hurry over the
rugged Alps, that you may be the delight of boys, and furnish
subjects for declamations!<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>One<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> world is not enough for the youth of Pella! He
chafes within the narrow limits of the universe, poor soul, as
though confined in Gyarus'<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> small rock, or scanty Seriphös.

fortified, he will be content with a sarcophagus!<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Death
alone discloses how very small are the puny bodies of men!
Men do believe that Athos was sailed through of yore; and
all the bold assertions that lying Greeks hazard in history&mdash;that
the sea was bridged over by the same fleets, and formed
into a solid pavement for the transit of wheels. We believe
that deep rivers failed, and streams were drunk dry<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Persian dined; and all the flights of Sostratus'<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> song, when
his wings are moistened by the god of wine. And yet, in
what guise did <em>he</em> return after quitting Salamis, who, like a
true barbarian as he was, used to vent his rage in scourges on
Corus and Eurus, that had never suffered in this sort in
Æolus' prison; and bound in gyves Ennosigæus<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> himself. It
was, in fact, an act of clemency that he did not think he deserved
branding<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> also. Would any of the gods choose to
serve<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> such a man as this? But how did he return? Why,
in a single ship; through waves dyed with blood, and with
his galley retarded<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> by the shoals of corpses. Such was the
penalty that glory, for which he had so often prayed, exacted.</p>

<p>"Grant length of life, great Jove, and many years!" This
is your only prayer in health and sickness. But with what
unremitting and grievous ills is old age crowded! First of
all, its face is hideous, loathsome, and altered from its former
self; instead of skin a hideous hide and flaccid cheeks; and
see! such wrinkles, as, where Tabraca<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> extends her shady
dells, the antiquated ape<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> scratches on her wizened jowl!
There are many points of difference in the young: this youth
is handsomer than that; and he again than a third: one is far
sturdier than another. Old mens faces are all alike&mdash;limbs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>tottering and voice feeble,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> a smooth bald pate, and the second
childhood of a driveling nose; the poor wretch must mumble
his bread with toothless gums; so loathsome to his wife, his
children, and even to himself, that he would excite the disgust
even of the legacy-hunter Cossus! His palate<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> is grown dull;
his relish for his food and wine<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> no more the same; the joys
of love are long ago forgotten; and in spite of all efforts to
reinvigorate them, all manly energies are hopelessly extinct.
Has this depraved and hoary lechery aught else to hope? Do
we not look with just suspicion on the lust that covets the sin
but lacks the power?<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>Now turn your eyes to the loss of another sense. For
what pleasure has he in a singer, however eminent a harper
it may be; nay, even Seleucus himself; or those whose habit
it is to glitter in a cloak of gold?<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> What matters it in what
part of the wide theatre he sits, who can scarcely hear the
horn-blowers, and the general clang of trumpets? You must
bawl out loud before his ear can distinguish who it is his slave
says has called, or tells him what o'clock it is.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Besides, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>scanty blood that flows in his chill<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> body is warmed by fever
only. Diseases of every kind dance round him in full choir.
If you were to ask their names, I could sooner tell you how
many lovers Hippia had; how many patients Themison<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> killed
in one autumn; how many allies Basilus plundered; how
many wards Hirrus defrauded; how many lovers long Maura
received in the day; how many pupils Hamillus corrupts. I
could sooner run through the list of villas owned by him now,
beneath whose razor<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> my stiff beard resounded when I was in
my prime. One is weak in the shoulder; another in the
loins; another in the hip. Another has lost both eyes, and
envies the one-eyed. Another's bloodless lips receive their
food from others' fingers. He that was wont to relax his
features to a smile at the sight of his dinner, now only gapes<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
like the young swallow to whom the parent bird, herself fasting,<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
flies with full beak. But worse than all debility of limb
is that idiocy which recollects neither the names of his slaves
nor the face of the friend with whom he supped the evening
before; not even those whom he begot and brought up! For
by a heartless will he disinherits them; and all his property
is made over to Phiale:<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>&mdash;such power has the breath of her
artificial mouth, that stood for hire so many years in the
brothel's dungeon.</p>

<p>Even though the powers of intellect retain their vigor, yet
he must lead forth the funerals of his children; must gaze
upon the pyre of a beloved wife, and the urns filled with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>that remains of his brother and sisters. This is the penalty
imposed on the long-lived, that they must grow old with the
death-blow in their house forever falling fresh&mdash;in oft-recurring
sorrow&mdash;in unremitting mourning, and a suit of black.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
The king of Pylos,<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> if you put any faith in great Homer, was
an instance of life inferior in duration only to the crow's.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
Happy, no doubt! was he who for so many years put off his
hour of death; and now begins to count his years on his
right hand,<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and has drunk so often of the new-made wine.
I pray you, lend me your ear a little space; and hear how
sadly he himself complains of the decrees of fate, and too
great powers of life, when he watches the blazing beard of
Antilochus<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> in his bloom, and asks of every friend that stands
near, why it is he lingers on to this day; what crime he has
committed to deserve so long a life! Such, too, is Peleus'
strain, when he mourns for Achilles prematurely snatched
from him: and that other, whose lot it was to grieve for the
shipwrecked<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> Ithacensian.</p>

<p>Priam would have joined the shade of Assaracus with Troy
still standing, with high solemnities, with Hector and his
brothers supporting his bier on their shoulders, amid the weeping
Troades, so that Cassandra would lead off the wail, and
Polyxena<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> with mantle rent, had he but died at any time
but that, after that Paris had begun to build his audacious
ships. What then did length of days confer on him? He
saw his all o'erthrown: Asia laid low by flame and sword.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Then the poor tottering warrior<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> laid down his diadem and
donned his arms, and fell before the altar of supreme Jove;
like some old ox<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> that yields his attenuated and miserable
neck to his owner's knife, long ago scorned<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> by the ungrateful
plow.</p>

<p>That was at all events the death of a human being: but his
wife who survived him barked fiercely from the jaws of a
bitch.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>I hasten on to our own countrymen, and pass by the king
of Pontus, and Crœsus,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> whom the eloquent voice of the right-judging
Solon bade look at the closing scene<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> of a life however
long. Banishment, and the jail, and the marshes of
Minturnæ,<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> and his bread begged in conquered Carthage, took
their rise from this. What could all nature, what could
Rome, have produced more blessed in the wide world than that
citizen, had he breathed forth his soul<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> glutted with spoils,
while the captive train followed around his chariot, in all the
pomp and circumstance of war, when he was about to alight
from his Teutonic<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> car! Campania,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> in her foresight for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>Pompey, had given him a fever he should have prayed for.
But the many cities and their public prayers prevailed.
Therefore his own malignant fortune and that of Rome preserved
him only that conquered he should lose his head.
Lentulus<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> escaped this torment; Cethegus paid not this penalty,
but fell unmutilated; and Catiline lay with corpse
entire. The anxious mother, when she visits Venus' temple,
prays for beauty for her boys with subdued whisper;<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> with
louder voice for her girls, carrying her fond wishes<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> even to
the verge of trifling. "But why should you chide me?" she
says; "Latona<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> delights in the beauty of Diana." But, Lucretia<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
forbids a face like hers to be the subject of your prayers:
Virginia would gladly give hers to Rutila, and receive her
wen in exchange. But, a son possessed of exquisite person
keeps his parents in a constant state of misery and alarm.
So rare is the union<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> of beauty with chastity. Though the
house, austere in virtue, and emulating the Sabines of old,
may have handed down,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> like an inheritance, purity of morals,
and bounteous Nature with benignant hand may give, besides,
a chaste mind and a face glowing with modest blood (for
what greater boon can Nature bestow on a youth? Nature,
more powerful than any guardian, or any watchful care!),
still they are not allowed to attain to manhood. For the
villainy of the corrupter, prodigal in its guilt, dares to assail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>with tempting offers the parents themselves. So great is
their confidence in the success of bribes! No tyrant in his
cruel palace ever castrated a youth that was deformed; nor
did even Nero carry off a stripling if club-footed, or disfigured
by wens, pot-bellied, and humpbacked! Go then, and exult
in the beauty of your darling boy! Yet for whom are there
greater perils in store? He will become the adulterer of the
city, and dread all the punishments<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> that angry husbands
inflict. Nor will he be more lucky than the star of Mars,
even though he never fall like Mars into the net.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> But sometimes
that bitter wrath exacts even more than any law permits,
to satisfy the husband's rage. One dispatches the
adulterer with the sword; another cuts him in two with
bloody lashes; some have the punishment of the mullet. But
your Endymion, forsooth, will of course become the lover of
some lady of his affections! But soon, when Servilia<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> has
bribed him, he will serve her whom he loves not, and will
despoil her of all her ornaments. For what will any woman
refuse, to get her passions gratified? whether she be an Oppia,
or a Catulla. A depraved woman has all her morality<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> concentred
there. "But what harm does beauty do one that is
chaste?" Nay, what did his virtuous resolve avail Hippolytus,
or what Bellerophon? Surely she<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> fired at the rejection
of her suit, as though treated with indignity. Nor did
Sthenobæa burn less fiercely than the Cretan; and both lashed
themselves into fury. A woman is then most ruthless, when
shame sets sharper spurs<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> to her hate. Choose what course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>you think should be recommended him to whom Cæsar's
wife<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> purposes to marry herself. This most noble and most
beautiful of the patrician race is hurried off, poor wretched
man, a sacrifice to the lewd eyes of Messalina. She is long
since seated with her bridal veil all ready: the nuptial bed
with Tyrian hangings is openly prepared in the gardens, and,
according to the antique rites, a dowry of a million sesterces
will be given; the soothsayer<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> and the witnesses to the settlement
will be there! Do you suppose these acts are kept
secret; intrusted only to a few? She will not be married
otherwise than with all legal forms. Tell me which alternative
you choose. If you refuse to comply, you must die before
nightfall.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> If you <em>do</em> commit the crime, some brief
delay will be afforded you, until the thing, known to the city
and the people,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> shall reach the prince's ears. He will be the
last to learn the disgrace of his house! Do you meanwhile
obey her behests, if you set so high a value on a few days'
existence. Whichever you hold the better and the safer
course, that white and beauteous neck must be presented<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> to
the sword!</p>

<p>Is there then nothing for which men shall pray? If you
will take advice, you will allow the deities themselves to determine
what may be expedient for us, and suitable to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>condition. For instead of pleasant things, the gods will give
us all that is most fitting. Man is dearer to them than to
himself. We, led on by the impulse of our minds, by blind
and headstrong passions, pray for wedlock, and issue by our
wives; but it is known to them what our children will prove;
of what character our wife will be! Still, that you may have
somewhat to pray for, and vow to their shrines the entrails
and consecrated mincemeat<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> of the white porker, your prayer
must be that you may have a sound mind in a sound body.
Pray for a bold spirit, free from all dread of death; that
reckons the closing scene of life among Nature's kindly boons;<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>
that can endure labor, whatever it be; that deems the gnawing
cares of Hercules,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> and all his cruel toils, far preferable to
the joys of Venus, rich banquets, and the downy couch of
Sardanapalus. I show thee what thou canst confer upon thyself.
The only path that surely leads to a life of peace lies
through virtue. If <em>we</em> have wise foresight, <em>thou</em>, Fortune,
hast no divinity.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> It is we that make thee a deity, and place
thy throne in heaven!<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

to open the Circensian games, and a triumphal procession. The latter
proceeded through the principal streets <em>to</em> the Capitol. The former, <em>from</em>
the Capitol to the <em>centre</em> of the circus. The triumphal car was in the
shape of a turret, gilded, and drawn by four white horses: it often occurs
on coins. The tunica palmata, worn by generals in their triumph, was
kept in the temple of Jupiter. The toga picta was purple, and so heavily
embroidered that it may well be compared to a brocaded curtain.
Tyre was anciently called Sarra, which may be traced in its modern
name Sur.

Martias ageretur." So "post diem sextum" was called Sexatrus; and
"post diem septimum," Septimatrus. Varro, L. L., v., 3. It was afterward
<em>extended</em> to five days; hence the "vulgus" supposed that to have
been the origin of the name; and so Ovid takes it, "Nominaque a junctis
quinque diebus habet," Fast., iii., 809; who says it was kept in honor of
Minerva's natal day, "Causa quod est illâ nata Minerva die," l. 812.
(Others say, because on that day her temple on Mount Aventine was consecrated.)
Domitian kept the festival in great state at his Alban villa.
Suet., Domit., iv. Cicero has a punning allusion to it. Vid. Fam., xii.,
25. These five days were the schoolmasters' holidays; and on the first
they received their pay, or entrance fee, διδακτρὰ, hence called Minerval;
though Horace seems to imply they were paid every month, "Octonis
referentes Idibus æra." I., Sat. vi., 75. The lesser Quinquatrus
were on the Ides of June. Ov., Fast., vi., 651, "Quinquatrus jubeor

<h3>SATIRE XI.</h3>

<p>If Atticus<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> sups extravagantly, he is considered a splendid<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
fellow: if Rutilus does so, he is thought mad. For what is
received with louder laughter on the part of the mob, than
Apicius<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> reduced to poverty?</p>

<p>Every club,<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> the baths, every knot of loungers, every theatre,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
is full of Rutilus. For while his sturdy and youthful limbs
are fit to bear arms,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> and while he is hot in blood, he is driven<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
(not indeed forced to it, but unchecked by the tribune) to copy
out<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> the instructions and imperial commands of the trainer
of gladiators. Moreover, you see many whom their creditor,
often cheated of his money, is wont to look out for at the very
entrance of the market;<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> and whose inducement to live exists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>in their palate alone. The greatest wretch among these, one
who must soon fail, since his ruin is already as clear<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> as day,
sups the more extravagantly and the more splendidly. Meanwhile
they ransack all the elements for dainties;<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> the price
never standing in the way of their gratification. If you look
more closely into it, those please the more which are bought
for more. Therefore they have no scruple<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> in borrowing a
sum, soon to be squandered, by pawning<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> their plate, or the
broken<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> image of their mother; and, with the 400<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> sesterces,
seasoning an earthen<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> dish to tickle their palate. Thus they
are reduced to the hotch-potch<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> of the gladiator.</p>

<p>It makes therefore all the difference who it is that procures
these same things. For in Rutilus it is luxurious extravagance.
In Ventidius it takes a praiseworthy name, and derives
credit from his fortune.</p>

<p>I should with reason despise the man who knows how

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>One must know one's own measure, and keep it in view, in
the greatest and in most trifling matters; even when a fish is
to be bought. Do not long for a mullet,<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> when you have only

and whole fortune is squandered<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> upon your belly, what
can hold your money out at interest, your solid plate, your
flocks, and lands?</p>

<p>By such proprietors as these, last of all<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> the ring is parted

premature funeral pile, or the grave, that is luxury's horror,
but old age,<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> more to be dreaded than death itself. These
are most commonly the steps: money, borrowed at Rome, is
spent before the very owners' faces; then when some trifling
residue is left, and the lender of the money is growing pale,
they give leg-bail<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> and run to Baiæ and Ostia. For now-a-days
to quit the forum<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> is not more discreditable to you than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>to remove to Esquiline from hot<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Suburra. This is the only

a drop of blood remains in their face; few attempt to detain
modesty, now become an object of ridicule and fleeing from

<p>You shall prove to-day by your own experience, Persicus,
whether all these things, which are very fine to talk about, I

the vines: pears from Signia<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> and Syria: and, from the same
basket, apples rivaling those of Picenum,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> and smelling quite
fresh; that you need not be afraid of, since they have lost
their autumnal moisture, which has been dried up by cold,
and the dangers to be feared from their juice if crude. This
would in times gone by have been a luxurious supper for our
senate. Curius<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> with his own hands used to cook over his
little fire pot-herbs which he had gathered in his little garden:
such herbs as now the foul digger in his heavy chain
rejects with scorn, who remembers the flavor of the vile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>dainties<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> of the reeking cook-shop. It was the custom formerly
to keep against festival days the flitches of the smoked
swine, hanging from the wide-barred rack, and to set bacon
as a birthday treat before one's relations, with the addition of
some fresh meat, if a sacrificial victim furnished any. Some
one of the kin, with the title of "Thrice consul," that had
held command in camps, and discharged the dignity of dictator,
used to go earlier<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> than his wont to such a feast as this,
bearing his spade over his shoulder from the mountain he had
been digging on. But when men trembled at the Fabii,<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> and
the stern Cato, and the Scauri and Fabricii;<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and when, in fine,
even his colleague stood in dread of the severe character of the
strict Censor; no one thought it was a matter of anxiety or
serious concern what kind of tortoise<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> floated in the wave of
ocean, destined to form a splendid and noble couch for the
Trojugenæ. But with side devoid of ornament, and sofas of
diminutive size, the brazen front displayed the mean head of
an ass wearing a chaplet,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> at which the country lads laughed
in wantonness.</p>

<p>The food then was in keeping with the master of the house
and the furniture. Then the soldier, uncivilized, and too ignorant<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
to admire the arts of Greece, used to break up the
drinking-cups, the work of some renowned artists, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>found in his share of the booty when cities were overthrown,
that his horse might exult in trappings,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> and his embossed
helmet might display to his enemy on the point of perishing,
likenesses of the Romulean wild beast bidden to grow tame
by the destiny of the empire, and the twin Quirini beneath
the rock, and the naked image of the god coming down<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> with
buckler and spear, and impending over him. Whatever silver
he possessed glittered on his arms<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> alone. In those days,
then, they used to serve all their furmety in a dish of Tuscan
earthenware: which you may envy, if you are at all that way
inclined.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>The majesty of temples also was more evidently near<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> to
men, and a voice<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> heard about midnight and through the midst
of the city, when the Gauls were coming from the shore of
ocean, and the gods discharged the functions of a prophet,
warned us of these.</p>

<p>This was the care which Jupiter used to show for the affairs
of Latium, when made of earthenware,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> and as yet profaned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>by no gold. Those days saw tables made of wood grown
at home and from our native trees.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> To these uses was the
timber applied, if the east wind had chanced to lay prostrate
some old walnut-tree. But now the rich have no satisfaction
in their dinner, the turbot and the venison lose their flavor,
perfumes and roses seem to lose their smell, unless the broad
circumference of the table is supported by a huge mass of
ivory, and a tall leopard with wide-gaping jaws, made of those
tusks, which the gate of Syene<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> transmits, and the active
Moors, and the Indian of duskier hue than the Moor;<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> and
which the huge beast has deposited in some Nabathæan<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> glen,
as now grown too weighty and burdensome to his head: by
this their appetite<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> is whetted: hence their stomach acquires
its vigor. For a leg of a table made only of silver is to them
what an iron ring on their finger would be: I therefore cautiously
avoid a proud guest, who compares me with himself,
and looks with scorn on my paltry estate. Consequently I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>not possess a single ounce of ivory: neither my chess-board<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
nor my men are of this material; nay, the very handles of my
knives are of bone. Yet my viands never become rank in
flavor by these, nor does my pullet cut up the worse on that
account. Nor yet will you see a carver, to whom the whole
carving-school<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> ought to yield the palm, some pupil of the
professor Trypherus, at whose house the hare, with the large
sow's udders,<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> and the wild boar, and the roebuck,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and pheasants,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
and the huge flamingo,<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and the wild goat<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> of Gætulia,
all forming a most splendid supper, though made of elm, are
carved with the blunted knife, and resounds through the whole
Suburra. My little fellow, who is a novice, and uneducated
all his days, does not know how to take dexterously off a slice
of roe, or the wing of a Guinea-hen;<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> only versed in the mysteries
of carving the fragments of a small collop.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>My slave, who is not gayly dressed, and only clad so as to
protect him from cold, will hand you plebeian cups<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> bought
for a few pence. He is no Phrygian or Lycian, or one purchased
from the slave-dealer<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> and at great price. When you
ask for any thing, ask in Latin. They have all the same
style of dress; their hair close-cropped and straight, and only
combed to-day on account of company. One is the son of a
hardy shepherd, another of a neat-herd: he sighs after his
mother, whom he has not seen for a long time, and pines for
his hovel<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> and his playmate kids. A lad of ingenuous face,
and ingenuous modesty; such as <em>those</em> ought to be who are
clothed in brilliant purple. He shall hand you wine<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> made
on those very hills from which he himself comes, and under
whose summit he has played; for the country of the wine and
the attendant is one and the same.</p>

<p>Gambling is disgraceful, and so is adultery, in men of moderate
means. Yet when rich men commit all those abominations,
they are called jovial, splendid fellows. Our banquet
to-day will furnish far different amusements. The author of
the Iliad<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> shall be recited, and the verses of high-sounding
Mars, that render the palm doubtful. What matter is it with
what voice such noble verses are read?<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> But now having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>put off all your cares, lay aside business, and allow yourself a
pleasing respite, since you will have it in your power to be
idle all day long. Let there be no mention of money out at
interest. Nor if your wife is accustomed to go out at break
of day and return at night, let her stir up your bile,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> though
you hold your tongue. Divest yourself at once of all that
annoys you, at my threshold. Banish all thoughts of home
and servants, and all that is broken and wasted<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> by them&mdash;especially
forget ungrateful friends! Meantime, the spectacles
of the Megalesian towel<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> grace the Idæan solemnity: and, like
one in a triumph, the prey of horses, the prætor, sits: and, if
I may say so without offense to the immense and overgrown
crowd, the circus to-day incloses the whole of Rome;<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> and a din
reaches my ears, from which I infer the success of the green
faction.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> For should it not win, you would see this city in
mourning and amazement, as when the consuls were conquered
in the dust<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> of Cannæ. Let young men be spectators of these,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>in whom shouting and bold betting, and sitting by a trim
damsel is becoming. Let our skin,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> which is wrinkled with
age, imbibe the vernal sun and avoid the toga'd crowd. Even
now, though it wants a whole hour to the sixth, you may go
to the bath with unblushing brow. You could not do this for
five successive days; because even of such a life as this there
would be great weariness. It is a more moderate use<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> that
enhances pleasures.</p>

Pliny says that Cicero himself, who accuses Verres of stealing a
Citrea mensa from Diodorus (in Verr., iv., 17), gave a million of sesterces
for one which was in existence in his time. A "Senatoris Census" was
a price given. These tables were not provided with several feet, but
rested on an ivory column (sometimes carved into the figure of animals),
hence called monopodia. They were called "Orbes," not from being
<em>round</em>, but because they were massive plates of wood cut off the stem in
its whole diameter. The wood of the <em>citrus</em> was most preferred. This
is not the <em>citron</em>-tree, which never attains to this bulk, but a tree found in
Mauritania, called the thyæ cypressides. Plin., xiii., 16. Those cut near
the root were most valued from the wood being variegated: hence "Tigrinæ,
pantherinæ, pavonum caudæ oculos imitantes." The mensæ were
formerly square, but were afterward round to suit the new fashion of
the Sigma couch. The Romans also understood the art of veneering
tables and other furniture with the citrus wood and tortoise-shell.</p></div>

<h3>SATIRE XII.</h3>

<p>This day, Corvinus, is a more joyful one to me than even
my own birthday;<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> in which the festal altar of turf<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> awaits
the animals promised to the gods.</p>

<p>To the queen of the gods we sacrifice a snow-white<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> lamb:
a similar fleece shall be given to her that combated the Mauritanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Gorgon.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> But the victim reserved for Tarpeian Jupiter,
shakes, in his wantonness, his long-stretched<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> rope, and
brandishes his forehead. Since he is a sturdy calf; ripe for
the temple and the altar, and ready to be sprinkled with wine;
ashamed any longer to drain his mother's<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> teats, and butts the
oaks with his sprouting horn.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> Had I an ample fortune, and
equal to my wishes, a bull fatter than Hispulla,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> and slow-paced
from his very bulk, should be led to sacrifice, and one
not fed in a neighboring pasture; but his blood should flow,
giving evidence of the rich pastures of Clitumnus,<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> and with
a neck that must be struck by a ministering priest of great
strength, to do honor to the return of my friend who is still
trembling, and has recently endured great horrors, and wonders
to find himself safe.</p>

<p>For besides the dangers of the sea, and the stroke of the
lightning which he escaped, thick darkness obscured the sky
in one huge cloud, and a sudden thunder-bolt struck the
yard-arms, while every one fancied he was struck by it, and
at once, amazed, thought that no shipwreck could be compared
in horror with a ship on fire.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> For all things happen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>so, and with such horrors accompanying, when a storm
arises in poetry.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>Now here follows another sort of danger. Hear, and pity
him a second time; although the rest is all of the same description.
Yet it is a very dreadful part, and one well known
to many, as full many a temple testifies with its votive picture.
(Who does not know that painters<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> are maintained by Isis?)
A similar fortune befell our friend Catullus also: when the
hold was half full of water, and when the waves heaved up
each side alternately of the laboring ship, and the skill of
the hoary pilot could render no service, he began to compound
with the winds by throwing overboard, imitating the beaver
who makes a eunuch<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> of himself, hoping to get off by the sacrifice
of his testicles; so well does he know their medicinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>properties. "Throw overboard all that belongs to me, the
whole of it!" cried Catullus, eager to throw over even his
most beautiful things&mdash;a robe of purple fit even for luxurious
Mæcenases, and others whose very fleece the quality of the
generous pasture has tinged, moreover the exquisite water
with its hidden properties, and the atmosphere of Bætica<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
contributes to enhance its beauty. He did not hesitate to
cast overboard even his plate, salvers the workmanship of
Parthenius, a bowl<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> that would hold three gallons, and worthy
of Pholus when thirsty, or even the wife of Fuscus.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Add
to these bascaudæ,<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> and a thousand chargers, a quantity of
embletic work, out of which the cunning purchaser of Olynthus<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>
had drunk. But what other man in these days, or in
what quarter of the globe, has the courage to prefer his
life to his money, and his safety to his property? Some men
do not make fortunes for the sake of living, but, blinded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>avarice, live for the sake of money-getting. The greatest
part even of necessaries is thrown overboard: but not even do
these sacrifices relieve the ship&mdash;then, in the urgency of the
peril, it came to such a pitch that he yielded his mast to the
hatchet, and rights himself at last, though in a crippled state.
Since this is the last resource in danger we apply, to make the
ship lighter.</p>

<p>Go now, and commit your life to the mercy of the winds;
trusting to a hewn plank, with but four digits<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> between you
and death, or seven at most, if the deal is of the thickest. And
then together with your provision-baskets and bread and
wide-bellied flagon,<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> look well that you lay in hatchets,<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> to be
brought into use in storms.</p>

<p>But when the sea subsided into calm, and the state of affairs
was more propitious to the mariner, and his destiny prevailed
over Eurus and the sea, when now the cheerful Parcæ draw
kindlier tasks with benign hand, and spin white wool,<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> and
what wind there is, is not much stronger than a moderate
breeze, the wretched bark, with a poor make-shift, ran before
it, with the sailors' clothes spread out, and with its only
sail that remained: when now the south wind subsided, together
with the sun hope of life returned. Then the tall peak
beloved by Iulus, and preferred as a home by him to Lavinium,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>
his stepmother's seat, comes in sight; to which the white sow<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>gave its name&mdash;(an udder that excited the astonishment of
the gladdened Phrygians)&mdash;illustrious from what had never
been seen before, thirty paps. At length he enters the moles,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>
built through the waters inclosed within them, and the Pharos
of Tuscany, and the arms extending back, which jut out into
the middle of the sea, and leave Italy far behind. You would
not bestow such admiration on the harbor which nature formed:
but with damaged bark, the master steers for the inner
smooth waters of the safe haven, which even a pinnace of Baiæ
could cross; and there with shaven crowns<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> the sailors, now
relieved from anxiety, delight to recount their perils that form
the subject of their prating.</p>

<p>Go then, boys, favoring with tongues and minds,<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> and
place garlands in the temples, and meal on the sacrificial
knives, and decorate the soft hearths and green turf-altar. I
will follow shortly, and the sacrifice which is most important<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>having been duly performed, I will then return home, where
my little images, shining in frail wax, shall receive their slender
chaplets. Here I will propitiate<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> my own Jove, and offer
incense to my hereditary Lares,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> and will display all colors of
the violet. All things are gay; my gateway has set up long
branches,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and celebrates the festivities<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> with lamps lighted in
the morning.</p>

<p>Nor let these things be suspected by you, Corvinus. Catullus,
for whose safe return I erect so many altars, has three
little heirs. You may wait long enough for a man that would
expend even a sick hen at the point of death for so unprofitable
a friend. But even this is too great an outlay. Not even a
quail will ever be sacrificed in behalf of one who is a father.
If rich Gallita<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> and Paccius, who have no children, begin to
feel the approach of fever, every temple-porch is covered
with votive tablets,<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> affixed according to due custom. There
are some who would even promise a hecatomb<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> of oxen.
Since elephants are not to be bought here or in Latium, nor
is there any where in our climate such a large beast generated;
but, fetched from the dusky nation, they are fed in the Rutulian
forests, and the field of Turnus, as the herd of Cæsar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>prepared to serve no private individual, since their ancestors
used to obey Tyrian Hannibal, and our own generals,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> and
the Molossian king, and to bear on their backs cohorts&mdash;no
mean portion of the war&mdash;and a tower that went into battle.
It is no fault, consequently, of Novius, or of Ister Pacuvius,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>
that that ivory is not led to the altars, and falls a sacred victim
before the Lares of Gallita, worthy of such great gods,
and those that court their favor! One of these two fellows,
if you would give him license to perform the sacrifice, would
vow the tallest or all the most beautiful persons among his
flock of slaves, or place sacrificial fillets on his boys and the
brows of his female slaves. And if he has any Iphigenia<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
at home of marriageable age, he will offer her at the altars,
though he can not hope for the furtive substitution of the
hind of the tragic poets. I commend my fellow-citizen, and
do not compare a thousand<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> ships to a will; for if the sick
man shall escape Libitina,<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> he will cancel his former will, entangled
in the meshes of the act,<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> after a service so truly wonderful:
and perhaps in one short line will give his all to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Pacuvius as sole<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> heir. Proudly will he strut over his defeated
rivals. You see, therefore, what a great recompense the

"Topino," near Mevania, now "Timia." The Tinia discharges itself into
the Tiber near Perusia. Pliny (viii., Ep. 8) gives a beautiful description
of its source, now called "La Vene," in a letter which is, as Gifford says,
a model of elegance and taste. Its waters were supposed to give a milk-white
color to the cattle who drank of them. Virg., Georg., ii., 146,
"Hinc albi, Clitumne, greges, et maxima taurus victima." Propert.,
II., xix., 25, "Quà formosa suo Clitumnus flumina luco Integit et niveos

Mediterranean, which, when seen single, were supposed to be fatal. Plin.,
ii., 37, "Graves cum solitarii venerunt mergentesque navigia, et si in carinæ
ima deciderint, exurentes." These fires, when <em>double</em>, were hailed
as a happy omen, as the stars of Castor and Pollux. "Fratres Helenæ
lucida sidera," Hor., I., Od. iii., 2; cf. xii., 27. The French call it "Le
feu St. Elme," said to be a corruption of "Helena." The Italian sailors
call them "St. Peter and St. Nicholas." But these only appear at the
<em>close</em> of a storm. Cf. Hor., ii., <em>seq.</em>, and Blunt's Vestiges, p. 37.</p></div>

noida suspendisse potenti vestimenta maris Deo." It seems to
have been the custom for persons in peril of shipwreck not only to vow
pictures of their perilous condition to some deity in case they escaped,
but also to have a painting of it made to carry about with them to excite
commiseration as they begged. Cf. xiv., 302, "Naufragus assem dum
rogat et pictâ se tempestate tuetur." Pers., i., 89, "Quum fractâ te in
trabe pictum ex humero portes." VI., 32, "Largire inopi, ne pictus

Quod superest tutum, Pontice Castor, habes!" This story of the
beaver is told Plin., viii., 30; xxxvii., 6, and is repeated by Silius, in a
passage copied from Ovid and Juvenal. "Fluminei veluti deprensus
gurgitis undis, Avulsâ parte <em>inguinibus causâque pericli</em>, Enatat intento
prædæ fiber avius hoste," xv., 485. But it is an error. The sebaceous
matter called castoreum (Pers., v., 135), is secreted by two glands near
the root of the tail. (Vid. Martyn's Georgics, i., 59, "Virosaque Pontus
Castorea," and Browne's Vulgar Errors, lib. iii., 4.) Pliny, viii., 3, tells
a similar story of the elephant, "Circumventi a venantibus dentes impactos

<h3>SATIRE XIII.</h3>

<p>Every act that is perpetrated, that will furnish a precedent
for crime, is loathsome<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> even to the author himself. This is
the punishment that first lights upon him, that by the verdict<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>
of his own breast no guilty man is acquitted; though the
corrupt influence of the prætor may have made his cause prevail,
by the urn<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> being tampered with. What think you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>Calvinus,<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> is the opinion of all men touching the recent villainy,
and the charge you bring of breach of trust? But it is
your good fortune not to have so slender an income, that the
weight of a trifling loss can plunge you into ruin; nor is
what you are suffering from an unfrequent occurrence. This
is a case well known to many&mdash;worn threadbare&mdash;drawn
from the middle of fortune's heap.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>Let us, then, lay aside all excessive complaints. A <em>man's</em>
grief ought not to blaze forth beyond the proper bounds, nor
exceed the loss sustained. Whereas <em>you</em> can scarcely bear
even the very least diminutive particle of misfortune, however
trifling, boiling with rage in your very bowels because
your friend does not restore to you the deposit he swore to
return. Can <em>he</em> be amazed at this, that has left threescore
years behind him, born when Fonteius was consul?<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> Have
you gained<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> nothing by such long experience of the world?
Noble indeed are the precepts which philosophy, that triumphs
over fortune, lays down in her books of sacred wisdom. Yet
we deem those happy too who, with daily life<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> for their instructress,
have learned to endure with patience the inconveniences
of life, and not shake off the yoke.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>What day is there so holy that is not profaned by bringing
to light theft, treachery, fraud&mdash;filthy lucre got by crime of
every dye, and money won by stabbing or by poison?<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> Since
rare indeed are the good! their number is scarce so many as
the gates of Thebes,<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> or the mouths of fertilizing Nile. We
are now passing through the ninth age of the world: an era
far worse than the days of Iron; for whose villainy not even
Nature herself can find a name, and has no metal<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> base enough
to call it by. Yet we call heaven and earth to witness, with
a shout as loud as that with which the Sportula,<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> that gives
them tongues, makes his clients applaud Fæsidius as he pleads.
Tell me, thou man of many years, and yet more fit to bear the
boss<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> of childhood, dost thou not know the charms that belong
to another's money? Knowest thou not what a laugh thy
simplicity would raise in the common herd, for expecting that
no man should forswear himself, but should believe some deity
is<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> really present in the temples and at the altars red with
blood? In days of old the aborigines perhaps used to live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>after this fashion: before Saturn in his flight laid down his
diadem, and adopted the rustic sickle: in the days when Juno
was a little maid; and Jupiter as yet in a private<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> station in
the caves of Ida: no banquetings of the celestials above the
clouds, no Trojan boy or beauteous wife of Hercules as cup-bearer;
or Vulcan (but not till he had drained the nectar)
wiping<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> his arms begrimed with his forge in Lipara. Then
each godship dined alone; nor was the crowd of deities so
great<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> as it is now-a-days: and the heavens, content with a few
divinities, pressed on the wretched Atlas with less grievous
weight. No one had as yet received as his share the gloomy
empire of the deep: nor was there the grim<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> Pluto with his
Sicilian bride, nor Ixion's wheel, nor the Furies, nor Sisyphus'
stone, nor the punishment of the black vulture,<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> but the
shades passed jocund days with no infernal king.</p>

<p>In that age villainy was a prodigy! They used to hold it
as a heinous sin, that naught but death could expiate, if a
young man had not risen up to pay honor to an old one,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> or a
boy to one whose beard was grown; even though he himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>gloated over more strawberries at home, or a bigger pile of
acorns.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>So just a claim to deference had even four years' priority;
so much on a par with venerated old age was the first dawn
of youth! Now, if a friend should not deny the deposit<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> intrusted
to him, if he should give back the old leathern purse
with all its rusty<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> coin untouched, it is a prodigy of honesty,
equivalent to a miracle,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> fit to be entered among the marvels
in the Tuscan records,<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> and that ought to be expiated by a
lamb crowned for sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> If I see a man above the common
herd, of real probity, I look upon him as a prodigy equal
to a child born half man, half brute;<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> or a shoal of fish turned
up by the astonished<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> plow; or a mule<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> with foal! in trepidation
as great as though the storm-cloud had rained stones;<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>or a swarm of bees<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> had settled in long cluster from some
temple's top; as though a river had flowed into the ocean with
unnatural eddies,<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> and rushing impetuous with a stream of
milk.</p>

<p>Do you complain of being defrauded of <em>ten</em> sestertia by impious
fraud? What if another has lost in the same way two
hundred, deposited without a witness!<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> and a third a still
larger sum than that, such as the corner of his capacious
strong-box could hardly contain! So easy and so natural is
it to despise the gods above,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> that witness all, if no mortal man
attest the same! See with how bold a voice he denies it!
What unshaken firmness in the face he puts on! He swears
by the sun's rays, by the thunderbolts of Tarpeian Jove, the
glaive of Mars, the darts of the prophet-god of Cirrha,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> by the
arrows and quiver of the Virgin Huntress, and by thy trident,
O Neptune, father of the Ægæan! He adds the bow of Hercules,
Minerva's spear, and all the weapons that the arsenals
of heaven hold.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> But if he be a father also, he says, "I am
ready to eat my wretched son's head boiled, swimming in vinegar
from Pharos."<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>There are some who refer all things to the accidents of fortune,<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
and believe the universe moves on with none to guide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>its course; while nature brings round the revolutions of days
and years. And therefore, without a tremor, are ready to lay
their hands<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> on any altar. Another does indeed dread that
punishment will follow crime; he thinks the gods <em>do</em> exist.
Still he perjures himself, and reasons thus with himself: "Let
Isis<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> pass whatever sentence she pleases upon my body, and
strike my eyes with her angry Sistrum, provided only that
when blind I may retain the money I disown. Are consumption,
or ulcerous sores, or a leg shriveled to half its bulk, such
mighty matters? If Ladas<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> be poor, let him not hesitate to
wish for gout that waits on wealth, if he is not mad enough to
require Anticyra<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> or Archigenes.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> For what avails the honor
of his nimble feet, or the hungry branch of Pisa's olive? All-powerful
though it be, that anger of the gods, yet surely it is
slow-paced! If, therefore, they set themselves to punish all
the guilty, when will they come to me? Besides, I may perchance
discover that the deity may be appeased by prayers!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"It is not unusual with him to pardon<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> such perjuries as these.
Many commit the same crimes with results widely different.
One man receives crucifixion<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> as the reward of his villainy;
another, a regal crown!"</p>

<p>Thus they harden their minds, agitated by terror inspired
by some heinous crime. Then, when you summon him to
swear on the sacred shrine, he will go first!<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Nay, he is quite
ready to drag you there himself, and worry you to put him to
this test. For when a wicked cause is backed by impudence,
it is believed by many to be the confidence<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> of innocence. He
acts as good a farce as the runaway slave, the buffoon in Catullus'<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>
Vision! You, poor wretch, cry out so as to exceed
Stentor,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> or, rather, as loudly as Gradivus<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> in Homer:
"Hearest thou<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> this, great Jove, and openest not thy lips,
when thou oughtest surely to give vent to some word, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>though formed of marble or of brass? Or, why then do we
place on thy glowing altar the pious<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> frankincense from the
wrapper undone, and the liver of a calf cut up, and the white
caul of a hog?<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> As far as I see, there is no difference to be
made between your image and the statue of Vagellius!"<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Now listen to what consolation on the other hand he can
offer, who has neither studied the Cynics, nor the doctrines of
the Stoics, that differ from the Cynics only by a tunic,<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> and
pays no veneration to Epicurus,<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> that delighted in the plants
of his diminutive garden. Let patients whose cases are desperate
be tended by more skillful physicians; you may trust
<em>your</em> vein even to Philippus' apprentice. If you can show
me no act so heinous in the whole wide world, then, I hold
my tongue; nor forbid you to beat your breast with your fists,
nor thump your face with open palm. For, since you really
<em>have</em> sustained loss, your doors must be closed; and money is
bewailed with louder lamentations from the household, and
with greater tumult,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> than deaths. No one, in such a case,
counterfeits sorrow; or is content with merely stripping<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>down the top of his garment, and vexing his eyes for forced
rheum.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> The loss of money is deplored with genuine tears.</p>

<p>But if you see all the courts filled with similar complaints,
if, after the deeds have been read ten times over, and each
time in a different quarter,<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> though their own handwriting,<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
and their principal signet-ring,<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> that is kept so carefully in
its ivory casket, convicts them, they call the signature a forgery
and the deed not valid; do you think that you, my fine
fellow, are to be placed without the common pale? What
makes <em>you</em> the chick of a white hen, while we are a worthless
brood, hatched from unlucky eggs? What you suffer is a
trifle; a thing to be endured with moderate choler, if you but
turn your eyes to crimes of blacker dye. Compare with it
the hired assassin, fires that originate from the sulphur of
incendiaries,<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> when your <em>outer</em> gate is the first part that
catches fire. Compare those who carry off the ancient temple's
massive cups,<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> incrusted with venerable rust&mdash;the gifts
of nations; or, crowns<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> deposited there by some king of ancient
days. If these are not to be had, there comes some
sacrilegious wretch that strikes at meaner prey; who will
scrape the thigh of Hercules incased in gold, and Neptune's
face itself, and strip off from Castor his leaf-gold. Will he,
forsooth, hesitate, that is wont to melt down whole the Thunderer<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>himself? Compare, too, the compounders and venders
of poisons;<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> or him that ought to be launched into the sea in
an ox's hide,<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> with whom the ape,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> herself innocent, is shut
up, through her unlucky stars. How small a portion is this
of the crimes which Gallicus,<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> the city's guardian, listens to
from break of day to the setting of the sun! Would you
study the morals of the human race, one house is quite enough.
Spend but a few days there, and when you come out thence,
call yourself, if you dare, a miserable man!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>or his flaxen hair with moistened ringlets twisted into horns?
Simply because, in these cases, one and all are alike by nature.</p>

<p>The pigmy<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> warrior in his puny panoply charges the
swooping birds of Thrace, and the cloud that resounds with the
clang of cranes. Soon, no match for his foe, he is snatched
away by the curved talons, and borne off through the sky by
the fierce crane. If you were to see this in our country, you
would be convulsed with laughter: but there, though battles
of this kind are sights of every day, no one even smiles,
where the whole regiment is not more than a foot high.</p>

<p>"And is there, then, to be no punishment at all for this
perjured wretch and his atrocious villainy?"</p>

<p>Well, suppose him hurried away at once, loaded with double
irons, and put to death in any way our wrath dictates
(and what could revenge wish for more?) still your loss remains
the same, your deposit will not be refunded! "But
the least drop of blood from his mangled body will give me a
consolation that might well be envied. Revenge is a blessing,
sweeter than life itself!" Yes! so fools think, whose breasts
you may see burning with anger for trivial causes, sometimes
for none at all. How small soever the occasion be, it is
matter enough for their wrath. Chrysippus<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> will not hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>the same language, nor the gentle spirit of Thales, or that
old man that lived by sweet Hymettus'<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> hill, who, even amid
those cruel bonds, would not have given his accuser one drop
of the hemlock<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> he received at his hands!</p>

<p>Philosophy, blessed<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> power! strips us by degrees of full many
a vice and every error! She is the first to teach us what is
right. Since revenge is ever the pleasure of a paltry spirit,
a weak and abject mind! Draw this conclusion <em>at once</em> from
the fact, that no one delights in revenge more than a woman!</p>

<p>Yet, why should you deem those to have escaped scot-free
whom their mind,<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> laden with a sense of guilt, keeps in constant
terror, and lashes with a viewless thong! Conscience,
as their tormentor, brandishing a scourge unseen by human
eyes! Nay! awful indeed is their punishment, and far more
terrible even than those which the sanguinary Cæditius<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> invents,
or Rhadamanthus! in bearing night and day in one's
own breast a witness against one's self.</p>

<p>The Pythian priestess gave answer to a certain Spartan,<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>that in time to come he should not go unpunished, because he
hesitated as to retaining a deposit, and supporting his villainy
by an oath. For he inquired what was the opinion of the
deity, and whether Apollo counseled him to the act.</p>

<p>He did restore it therefore; but through fear,<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> not from
principle. And yet he proved that every word that issued
from the shrine was worthy of the temple, and but too true:
being exterminated together with all his progeny and house,
and, though derived from a wide-spreading clan, with all his
kin! Such is the penalty which the mere wish to sin incurs.
For he that meditates within his breast a crime that finds not
even vent in words,<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> has all the guilt of the act!</p>

<p>What then if he has achieved his purpose? A respiteless
anxiety is his: that ceases not, even at his hours of meals:
while his jaws are parched as though with fever, and the food
he loathes swells<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> between his teeth. All wines<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> the miserable
wretch spits out; old Alban wine,<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> of high-prized antiquity,
disgusts him. Set better before him! and thickly-crowding
wrinkles furrow his brow, as though called forth by sour<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>
Falernian. At night, if anxious care has granted him per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>chance
a slumber however brief, and his limbs, that have been
tossing<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> over the whole bed, at length are at rest, immediately
he sees in dreams the temple and the altar of the deity he has
insulted; and, what weighs upon his soul with especial terrors,<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>
he sees thee! Thy awful<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> form, of more<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> than human
bulk, confounds the trembling wretch, and wrings confession<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
from him.</p>

<p>These are the men that tremble and grow pale at every lightning-flash;
and, when it thunders,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> are half dead with terror
at the very first rumbling<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> of heaven; as though not by mere
chance, or by the raging violence of winds, but in wrath and
vengeance the fire-bolt lights<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> upon the earth!<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> That last
storm wrought no ill! Therefore the next is feared with
heavier presage, as though but deferred by the brief respite of
this calm.</p>

<p>Moreover, if they begin to suffer pain in the side, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>wakeful fever, they believe the disease is sent to their bodies
from the deity, in vengeance. These they hold to be the stones
and javelins of the gods!</p>

<p>They dare not vow the bleating sheep to the shrine, or
promise even a cock's<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> comb to their Lares. For what hope
is vouchsafed to the guilty sick?<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> or what victim is not more
worthy of life? The character of bad men is for the most
part fickle and variable.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> While they are engaged in the
guilty act they have resolution enough, and to spare. When
their foul deeds are perpetrated, then at length they begin to
feel what is right and wrong.</p>

<p>Yet Nature<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> ever reverts to her depraved courses, fixed and
immutable. For who ever prescribed to himself a limit to his
sins? or ever recovered the blush<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> of ingenuous shame once
banished from his brow now hardened? What mortal man
is there whom you ever saw contented with a single crime?
This false friend of ours will get his foot entangled in the
noose, and endure the hook of the gloomy dungeon; or some
crag<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> in the Ægean Sea, or the rocks that swarm with exiles
of rank. You will exult in the bitter punishment of the hated
name; and at length with joy confess<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> that no one of the gods

for the purpose), the Prætor Urbanus, who sat as chief judge, chose
by lot about fifty to act as his assessors. To each of these were given
three tablets: one inscribed with the letter A. for "absolvo," one with the
letter C. for "condemno," and the third with the letters N. L. for "non
liquet," i. e., "not proven." After the case had been heard and the
judices had consulted together privately, they returned into court, and
each judex dropped one of these tablets into an urn provided for the purpose,
which was afterward brought to the prætor, who counted the number
and gave sentence according to the majority of votes. In all these
various steps, there was plenty of opportunity for the "gratia" of a corrupt
prætor to influence the "fallax urna."</p></div>

events of the year were registered by the Etruscan soothsayers in their
records, that, if they portended the displeasure of the gods, they might
be duly expiated. Various names are given by ancient writers to these
sacred or ritual books: Libri Etrusci; Chartæ Etruscæ; Scripta Etrusca;
Etruscæ disciplinæ libri; libri fatales, rituales, haruspicini, fulgurales;
libri Tagetici; sacra Tagetica; sacra Acherontica; libri Acherontici.

a sum of money to Glaucus a Spartan, who, when the Milesian's sons

he could safely retain it; but, terrified at the answer of the oracle, he
sent for the Milesians and restored the money. Leotychides relates the
story to the Athenians, and leaves them to draw the inference from the
fact he subjoins: Γλαύκου νῦν οὔτε τι ἀπόγονόν ἐστιν οὐδὲν, οὔτ' ἱστίη

<h3>SATIRE XIV.</h3>

<p>There are very many things, Fuscinus,<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> that both deserve a
bad name, and fix a lasting spot on a fortune otherwise splendid,
which parents themselves point the way to, and inculcate
upon their children. If destructive gambling<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> delights the
sire, the heir while yet a child plays<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> too; and shakes the
selfsame weapons in his own little dice-box. Nor will that
youth allow any of his kin to form better hopes of him who
has learned to peel truffles,<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> to season a mushroom,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> and drown
beccaficas<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> swimming in the same sauce, his gourmand sire
with his hoary gluttony<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> showing him the way. When his
seventh<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> year has past over the boy's head, and all his second
teeth are not yet come, though you range a thousand bearded<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>
philosophers on one side of him, and as many on the other,
still he will be ever longing to dine in sumptuous style, and
not degenerate from his sire's luxurious kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Does Rutilus<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> inculcate a merciful disposition and a character
indulgent to venial faults? does he hold that the souls
and bodies of our slaves<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> are formed of matter like our own
and of similar elements? or does he not teach cruelty, that
Rutilus, who delights in the harsh clang of stripes, and thinks
no Siren's<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> song can equal the sound of whips; the Antiphates<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>
and Polyphemus of his trembling household? Then is he
happy indeed whenever the torturer<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> is summoned, and some
poor wretch is branded with the glowing iron for stealing a
couple of towels! What doctrine does he preach to his son
that revels in the clank of chains, that feels a strange delight
in branded slaves,<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> and the country jail? Do you expect
that Larga's<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> daughter will not turn out an adulteress, who
could not possibly repeat her mother's lovers so quickly, or
string them together with such rapidity, as not to take breath
thirty times at least? While yet a little maid she was her
mother's confidante; now, at that mother's dictation<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> she fills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>her own little tablets, and gives them to her mother's agents
to bear to lovers of her own.</p>

<p>Such is Nature's law.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> The examples of vice that we witness
at home<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> more surely and quickly corrupt us, when they
insinuate themselves into our minds, under the sanction of
those we revere. Perhaps just one or two young men may
spurn these practices, whose hearts the Titan has formed with
kindlier art, and moulded out of better clay.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>But their sire's footsteps, that they ought to shun, lead on
all the rest, and the routine<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> of inveterate depravity, that has
been long before their eyes, attracts them on.</p>

<p>Therefore refrain<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> from all that merits reprobation. <em>One</em>
powerful motive, at least, there is to this&mdash;lest our children
copy our crimes. For we are all of us too quick at learning
to imitate base and depraved examples; and you may find a
Catiline in every people and under every sky; but nowhere
a Brutus,<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> or Brutus' uncle!</p>

<p>Let nothing shocking to eyes or ears approach those doors
that close upon your child. Away! far, far away,<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> the pander's

If you are contemplating a disgraceful act, despise not your
child's tender years, but let your infant son act as a check
upon your purpose of sinning. For if, at some future time,
he shall have done any thing to deserve the censor's<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> wrath,
and show himself like you, not in person only and in face,
but also the true son of your morals, and one who, by following
your footsteps, adds deeper guilt to your crimes&mdash;then,
forsooth! you will reprove and chastise him with clamorous
bitterness, and then set about altering your will. Yet how
dare you assume the front severe,<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> and license of a parent's
speech; you, who yourself, though old, do worse than this;
and the exhausted cupping-glass<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> is long ago looking out for
your brainless head?</p>

<p>If a friend is coming to pay you a visit, your whole household

the work, and brandishes his whip.</p>

<p>You are alarmed then, wretched man, lest your entrance-hall,
befouled by dogs, should offend the eye of your friend
who is coming, or your corridor be spattered with mud; and
yet one little slave could clean all this with half a bushel of
saw-dust. And yet, will you not bestir yourself that your
own son may see your house immaculate and free from foul
spot or crime? It deserves our gratitude that you have presented
a citizen to your country and people,<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> if you take care
that he prove useful to the state&mdash;of service to her lands;
useful in transacting the affairs both of war and peace. For
it will be a matter of the highest moment in what pursuits
and moral discipline you train him.</p>

<p>The stork feeds her young on snakes<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> and lizards which she
has discovered in the trackless fields. They too, when fledged,
go in quest of the same animals. The vulture, quitting the
cattle, and dogs, and gibbets, hastens to her callow brood, and
bears to them a portion of the carcass. Therefore this is the
food of the vulture too when grown up, and able to feed itself
and build a nest in a tree of its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereas the ministers of Jove,<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> and birds of noble blood,
hunt in the forest for the hare<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> or kid. Hence is derived the
quarry for their nest: hence too, when their progeny, now
matured, have poised themselves on their own wings, when
hunger pinches they swoop to that booty, which first they
tasted when they broke the shell.</p>

<p>Centronius had a passion for building; and now on the
embayed shore of Caieta,<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> now on the highest peak of
Tibur,<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> or on Præneste's<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> hills, he reared the tall roofs of
his villas, of Grecian<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> and far-fetched marbles; surpassing
the temple of Fortune<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> and of Hercules as much as Posides<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>the eunuch outvied our Capitol. While, therefore, he
is thus magnificently lodged, Centronius lessened his estate
and impaired his wealth. And yet the sum of the portion
that he left was no mean one: but all this his senseless son
ran through by raising new mansions of marble more costly
than his sire's.</p>

<p>Some whose lot it is to have a father that reveres sabbaths,
worship nothing save clouds and the divinity of heaven; and
think that flesh of swine, from which their sire abstained,
differs in naught from that of man. Soon, too, they submit to
circumcision. But, trained to look with scorn upon the laws
of Rome, they study and observe and reverence all those Jewish
statutes that Moses in his mystic volume handed down:
never to show the road except to one that worships the same
sacred rites&mdash;to conduct to the spring they are in quest of,
the circumcised<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> alone. But their father is to blame for this;
to whom each seventh<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> day was a day of sloth, and kept aloof
from all share of life's daily duties.</p>

<p>All other vices, however, young men copy of their own
free choice. Avarice is the only one that even against their
will they are constrained to put in practice. For this vice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>deceives men under the guise and semblance<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> of virtue. Since
it is grave in bearing&mdash;austere in look and dress. And without
doubt, the miser is praised "a frugal<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> character," "a
sparing man," and one that knows how to guard his own,<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>
more securely than if the serpent of the Hesperides<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> or of
Pontus had the keeping of them. Besides, the multitude considers
the man of whom we are speaking, a splendid carver<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
of his own fortune. Since it is by such artificers as these
that estates are increased. But still, increase they do by all
means, fair or foul, and swell in bulk from the ceaseless anvil
and ever-glowing forge.</p>

<p>The father, therefore, considers misers as men of happy
minds,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> since he admires wealth, and thinks no instance can
be found of a <em>poor</em> man that is also <em>happy</em>; and therefore exhorts
his sons to follow the same track, and apply themselves
earnestly to the doctrines of the same sect. There are certain
first elements<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> of all vices. These he instills into them in regular
order, and constrains them to become adepts in the most
paltry lucre. Presently he inculcates an insatiable thirst for
gain. While he is famishing himself, he pinches his servants'<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>
stomachs with the scantiest allowance.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> For he never endures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>to consume the whole of the blue fragments of mouldy<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> bread,
but saves, even in the middle of September,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> the mince<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> of
yesterday;<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> and puts by till to-morrow's dinner the summer
bean,<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> with a piece of stockfish and half a stinking shad:<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> and,
after he has counted them, locks up the shreds of chopped
leek.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> A beggar from a bridge<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> would decline an invitation
to such a meal as this! But to what end is money scraped
together at the expense of such self-torture? Since it is undoubted
madness,<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> palpable insanity, to <em>live</em> a beggar's life,
simply that you may <em>die</em> rich.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though the sack swells, full to the very brim,
the love of money grows<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> as fast as the money itself grows.
And he that has the less, the less he covets. Therefore you
are looking out for a second villa, since one estate is not
enough for you, and it is your fancy to extend<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> your territories;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>and your neighbor's corn-land seems to you more
spacious and fertile than your own; therefore you treat for
the purchase of this too, with all its woods and its hill that
whitens with its dense olive-grove. But if their owner will
not be prevailed upon to part with them at any price, then at
night, your lean oxen and cattle with weary necks, half-starved,
will be turned into his corn-fields while still green,
and not quit it for their own homes before the whole crop<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>
has found its way into their ruthless<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> stomachs&mdash;so closely
cropped that you would fancy it had been mown. You could
hardly tell how many have to complain of similar treatment,
and how many estates wrongs like this have brought to the
hammer. "But what says the world? What the trumpet
of slanderous fame?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What harm does this do me?"<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> he says; "I had rather
have a lupin's pod, than that the whole village neighborhood<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>
should praise me, if I am at the same time to reap the scanty
crops of a diminutive estate."</p>

<p>You will then, forsooth, be free from all disease<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>infirmity, and escape sorrow and care; and a lengthened span
of life will hereafter be your lot with happier destiny, if you
individually own as much arable land as the whole Roman
people used to plow under king Tatius. And after that, to
men broken down with years, that had seen the hard service
of the Punic wars, and faced the fierce Pyrrhus and the
Molossian swords, scarce two acres<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> a man were bestowed at
length as compensation for countless wounds. Yet that reward
for all their blood and toil never appeared to any less
than their deserts&mdash;or did their country's faith appear scant
or thankless. Such a little glebe as this used to satisfy the
father himself and all his cottage troop: where lay his pregnant
wife, and four children played&mdash;one a little slave,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> the
other three free-born. But for their grown-up brothers<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> when
they returned from the trench or furrow, there was another
and more copious supper prepared, and the big pots smoked
with vegetables. Such a plot of ground in our days is not
enough for a garden.</p>

<p>It is from this source commonly arise the motives to crime.
Nor has any vice of the mind of man mingled more poisons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>or oftener dealt<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> the assassin's knife, than the fierce lust for
wealth unlimited. For he that covets to grow rich,<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> would
also grow rich speedily. But what respect for laws, what fear
or shame is ever found in the breast of the miser hasting to
be rich? "Live contented with these cottages, my lads, and
these hills of ours!" So said, in days of yore, the Marsian
and Hernican and Vestine sire&mdash;"Let us earn our bread, sufficient
for our tables, with the plow. Of this the rustic deities<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a>
approve; by whose aid and intervention, since the boon
of the kindly corn-blade, it is man's fortune to loathe the oaks
he fed upon before. Naught that is forbidden will he desire
to do who is not ashamed of wearing the high country boots<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>
in frosty weather, and keeps off the east winds by inverted
skins. The foreign purple, unknown to us before, leads on to
crime and impiety of every kind."</p>

<p>Such were the precepts that these fine old fellows gave to
their children! But now, after the close of autumn, even at
midnight<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> the father with loud voice rouses his drowsy son:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, boy, get your tablets and write! Come, wake up!
Draw indictments! get up the rubricated statutes<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> of our
fathers&mdash;or else draw up a petition for a centurion's post.
But be sure Lælius observe your hair untouched by a comb,
and your nostrils well covered with hair,<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> and your good

on you the eagle that will make you rich. Or, if you shrink
from enduring the long-protracted labors of the camp, and the
sound of bugles and trumpets makes your heart faint, then
buy something that you may dispose of for more than half as
much again as it cost you; and never let disgust at any trade
that must be banished beyond the other bank of Tiber, enter
your head, nor think that any difference can be drawn between
perfumes or leather. The smell of gain is good<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>any thing whatever! Let this sentiment of the poet<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> be forever
on your tongue&mdash;worthy of the gods, and even great
Jove himself!&mdash;'No one asks how you <em>get</em> it, but <em>have</em> it you
must.' This maxim old crones impress on boys before they
can run alone. This all girls learn before their A B C."</p>

<p>Any parent whatever inculcating such lessons as these I
would thus address: Tell me, most empty-headed of men!
who bids you be in such a hurry? I engage your pupil
shall better your instruction. Don't be alarmed! You will
be outdone; just as Ajax outstripped Telamon, and Achilles
excelled Peleus.<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> Spare their tender years!<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> The bane of

Look upon your daughter-in-law as already buried, if she has

no labor! "I never recommended this," you will hereafter
say, "nor counseled such an act." Yet the cause and source
of this depravity of heart rests at your doors; for he that inculcated
a love for great wealth, and by his sinister lessons
trained up his sons to avarice,<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> <em>does</em> give full license, and gives

it, it can not be restrained, but, laughing you to scorn, is hurried
on, and leaves even the goal far behind. No one holds
it enough to sin just so much as you allow him, but men
grant themselves a more enlarged indulgence.</p>

<p>When you say to your son, "The man is a fool that gives

Augustus introduced the use of marble in public buildings, and many
edifices of his time were constructed of solid marble. All the columns
of the temple of Mars Ultor are of marble. (Vid. Niebuhr's Lectures,

which had they followed, they would not have been in Rome for Juvenal
to write about. These lines, in fact, instead of contradicting Josephus,

testimony to prove that they "<em>had</em> made the word of God of none

Its sands were said to have been changed into gold by Midas'
bathing in its waters, hence called εὔχρυσος by Sophocles. Philoct., 391.
It flows under the walls of Sardis, and is closely connected by the poets
with the name and wealth of Crœsus. The real fact being, that the gold
ore was washed down from Mount Tmolus; which Strabo says had
ceased to be the case in his time: lib. xiii., c. 4. Cf. Virg., Æn., x., 141,

his other freedmen, Posides, Felix, Polybius, etc., exercised unlimited
control over the idiotic Claudius, but Pallas and Narcissus were his chief
favorites, "Quos decreto quoque senatus, non præmiis modo ingentibus,
sed et quæstoriis prætoriisque ornamentis ornari libenter passus est:"
and so much did they abuse his kindness, that when he was once complaining
of the low state of his exchequer, it was said, "abundaturum
si à duobus libertis in consortium reciperetur." Claudius would have
certainly pardoned Messalina, had it not been for Narcissus. "Nec enim
Claudius Messalinam interfecisset, nisi properâsset index, delator adulterii,
et quodammodo imperator cædis Narcissus." See the whole account,
Tac., Ann., xi., 26-38. Suet., Claud., 26, <em>seq.</em> On the accession
of Nero, Narcissus was compelled by Agrippina to commit suicide.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>more atrocious than any tragedy could furnish. For from
the days of Pyrrha,<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> though you turn over every tragic

the guilt. Here, then, an instance which even in our own
days ruthless barbarism<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> produced. There is an inveterate
and long-standing grudge,<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> a deathless hatred and a rankling

Ombos<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> and Tentyra, two neighboring peoples. On both
sides the principal rancor arises from the fact that each
place hates its neighbor's gods,<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> and believes those only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ought to be held as deities which itself worships. But at a
festive period of one of those peoples, the chiefs and leaders
of their enemies determined that the opportunity must be
seized, to prevent their enjoying their day of mirth and cheerfulness,
and the delights of a grand dinner, when their tables
were spread near the temples and cross-ways, and the couch
that knows not sleep, since occasionally even the seventh day's
sun finds it still there, spread without intermission of either
night or day.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> Savage,<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> in truth, is Egypt! But in luxury,

fall short of the infamous Canopus.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<p>Besides, victory is easily gained over men reeking<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> with

crew of fellows dancing to a black piper; perfumes, such as
they were; and flowers, and garlands in plenty round their
brows. On the other side was ranged fasting hate. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>with minds inflamed, they begin first of all to give vent to
railings<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> in words.</p>

<p>This was the signal-blast<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> of the fray. Then with shouts
from both sides, the conflict begins; and in lieu of weapons,<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>
the unarmed hand rages.</p>

<p>Few cheeks were without a wound. Scarcely one, if any,
had a whole nose out of the whole line of combatants. Now
you might see, through all the hosts engaged, mutilated faces,<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>
features not to be recognized, bones showing ghastly beneath
the lacerated cheek, fists dripping with blood from their enemies'
eyes. But still the combatants themselves consider they
are only in sport, and engaged in a childish<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> encounter, because
they do not trample any corpses under foot. What,
forsooth, is the object of so many thousands mixing in the
fray, if no life is to be sacrificed? The attack, therefore, is
more vigorous; and now with arms inclined along the ground
they begin to hurl stones<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> they have picked up&mdash;Sedition's<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>

Forthwith the victorious crowd having cut him up into
numberless bits and fragments, in order that one dead man
might furnish a morsel for many, eat him completely up, having

their pale and emaciated features and wasted limbs, they in
their ravenous famine tore in pieces others' limbs, ready to

far from Syene, and consequently a hundred miles at least from Tentyra.
To avoid the difficulty, therefore, in the word "finitimos," Salmasius
would read "Coptos," this place being only twelve miles distant; but
all the best editions have Ombos. Tentyra, now "Denderah," lies on
the left bank of the river, and is well known from the famous discoveries
in its Temple by Napoleon's savans. The Tentyrites, as Strabo
tells us (xvii., p. 460; cf. Plin., H. N., viii., 25), differed from the rest of
their countrymen in their hatred and persecution of the crocodile, πάντα
τρόπον ἀνιχνεύουσι καὶ διαφθείρουσιν αὐτούς, being the only Egyptians
who dared attack or face them; and hence when some crocodiles were
conveyed to Rome for exhibition, some Tentyrite keepers accompanied
them, and displayed some curious feats of courage and dexterity. Aphrodite
was their patron deity. The men of Coptos, Ombos, and Arsinoë,
on the other hand, paid the crocodile the highest reverence; considering
it an honor to have their children devoured by them; and crucified kites
out of spite to the Tentyrites, who adored them. These religious differences
are said by Diodorus (ii., 4) to have been fostered by the policy of
the ancient kings, to prevent the conspiracies which might have resulted
from the cordial union and coalition of the various nomes.</p></div>

These lines prove that Juvenal was, <em>at some time of his life</em>, in Egypt;
but whether he traveled thither in early life to gratify his curiosity, or,
as the common story goes, was banished there in his old age to appease
the wrath of Paris, is doubtful. The latter story is inconsistent with

but Pampa is a much <em>smaller</em> place than Tentyra; and no one would
describe London, as Browne observes, as "London near Chelsea." He
imagines also that Juvenal is describing an affray that took place between
the people of Cynopolis and Oxyrynchis about this time, mentioned
by Plutarch (de Isid. et Osirid.), and that he has changed the names
for the sake of the metre. Heinrich leaves the difficulty unsolved.

<em>invidiam facere</em> means also "to bring into odium and unpopularity" (cf.
Ov., Met., iv., 547), and so Gifford understands it. "What more effectual
means could these cannibals devise to incense the god and provoke

"Nam quâ Pellæi gens fortunata Canopi Accolit effuso stagnantem flumine
Nilum Et circum <em>pictis</em> vehitur sua rura <em>phaselis</em>." The deficiency
of timber in Egypt forced the inhabitants to adopt any expedient as a
substitute. Strabo (lib. xvii.) mentions these vessels of pottery-ware,
varnished over to make them water-tight. Phaselus is properly the long
Egyptian kidney bean, from which the boats derived their name, from
their long and narrow form. From their speed they were much used by
pirates, and seem to have been of the same build as the Myoparones
mentioned by Cicero in Verrem, ii., 3. Cf. Catull., iv., 1, "Phaselus

dare Pythagoreis." Holding the doctrine of the Metempsychosis, Pythagoras
was averse to shedding the blood of any animal. Various reasons
are assigned for his abstaining from beans; from their shape&mdash;from their
turning to blood if exposed to moonshine, etc. Diog. Laert. says (lib.
viii. cap. i.), τῶν δὲ κυάμων ἀπηγόρευεν ἔχεσθαι διὰ τὸ πνευματώδεις
ὄντας μᾶλλον μετέχειν τοῦ ψυχικοῦ&mdash;καὶ τὰς καθύπνους φαντασίας λείας
καὶ ἀταράχους ἀποτελεῖν. In which view Cicero seems to concur: De
Div., ii., 119, "Pythagoras et Plato, quo in somnis certiora videamus,
præparatos quodam cultu atque victu proficisci ad dormiendum jubent:
Faba quidem Pythagorei utique abstinuere, quasi vero eo cibo mens non
venter infletur." Cf. Ov., Met., xv., 60, <em>seq.</em> See Browne's Vulgar Errors,
book i., chap. iv. (Bohn's Antiquarian Library): "When (Pythagoras)
enjoined his disciples an abstinence from <em>beans</em>, ... he had no
other intention than to dissuade men from magistracy, or undertaking the
public offices of the state; for by beans was the magistrate elected in
some parts of Greece; and after his days, we read in Thucydides of the
Council of the Bean in Athens. It hath been thought by some an injunction
only of continency."</p></div></div>


<h3>SATIRE XVI.</h3>

<p>Who could possibly enumerate, Gallus,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> all the advantages
that attend military service when fortunate? For if I could
but enter the camp with lucky omen, then may its gate welcome
me, a timid and raw recruit, under the influence of some
auspicious planet. For one hour of benignant Fate is of more
avail than even if Venus'<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> self should give me a letter of
recommendation to Mars, or his mother Juno, that delights in
Samos' sandy shore.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p>Let us treat, in the first place, of advantages in which all
share; of which not the least important is this, that no civilian<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>
must dare to strike you. Nay, even though he be
himself the party beaten,<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> he must dissemble his wrath, and
not dare to show the prætor<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> the teeth he has had knocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>out, and the black bruises on his face with its livid swellings,
and all that is left of his eye, which the physician can give
him no hopes of saving. If he wish to get redress for this, a
Bardiac<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> judge is assigned him&mdash;the soldier's boot, and stalwart
calves that throng the capacious benches of the camp,
the old martial law and the precedent of Camillus<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> being strictly
observed, "that no soldier shall be sued outside the trenches,
or at a distance from the standards."</p>

<p>Of course, where a <em>soldier</em> is concerned, the decision of the
centurion will needs be most equitable;<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> nor shall I lack my
just revenge, provided only the ground of the complaint I lay
be just and fair.</p>

<p>Yet the whole cohort is your sworn enemy; and all the
maniples, with wonderful unanimity, obstruct the course of
justice. Full well will they take care that the redress you
get shall be more grievous than the injury itself. It will be
an act, therefore, worthy of even the long-tongued Vagellius'
mulish heart,<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> while you have still a pair of legs to provoke
the ire of so many buskins, so many thousand hob-nails!<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>For who can go so far from Rome? Besides, who will be such
a Pylades<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> as to venture beyond the rampart of the camp?
So let us dry up our tears forthwith, and not trouble our
friends, who will be sure to excuse themselves. When the
judge calls on you, "Produce your witness,"<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> let the man,
whoever he may be, that saw the cuffs, have the courage to
stand forth and say, "I saw<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> the act," and I will hold him
worthy of the beard,<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> and worthy of the long hair of our ancestors.
You could with greater ease suborn a <em>false</em> witness
against a civilian,<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> than one who would speak the truth against
the fortune and the dignity of the man-at-arms.</p>

<p>Now let us observe other prizes and other solid advantages
of the military life. If some rascally neighbor has defrauded
me of a portion of the valley of my paternal fields, or encroached

wear armor, and buckle on the belt, whatever time suits <em>them</em>

away by the slow drag-chain<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> of the law.</p>

that sum of which the father holds the entire disposal. And
so it is, that while Coranus follows the standards and earns

agreed, though they arrive at it by different routes&mdash;"Your judge will be
some coarse, brutal, uncivilized soldier; who cares nothing for the feelings
of the toga'd citizen, or for the principles of justice." Marius is said to
have had a body-guard of slaves, who flocked to him, chiefly Illyrian;
whom he called his "Bardiæi." Pliny calls them "Vardæi," and Strabo
ἀρδιαῖοι. (Cf. Plut., in vit. Mar. Plin., iii., 32. Strabo, vii., 5.) Bardiacus
(or Bardaicus) may therefore be taken absolutely, or with judex,
or with calceus. If taken alone, then <em>cucullus</em> is said to be understood,
as Mart., xiv., 128, "Gallia Santonico vestit te Bardocucullo." i., Ep.
liv., 5; xiv., 139; IV., iv., 5. This "cowl" was made of goats' hair.
If taken with calceus, it would imply some such kind of shoe as the

to them nothing that has life, because it would be impious to stain the
stones with blood; but they offer wheaten cakes, and other first-fruits of
their crops." The divisions of land were maintained by investing the
stones which served as landmarks with a religious character: the removal
of these, therefore, added the crime of sacrilege to that of dishonesty, and
brought down on the heathen the curse invoked in the purer system of
theology, "Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark." Deut.,
xxvii., 17. To these rude stones, afterward sculptured (like the Hermæ)
into the form of the god Terminus above, the rustics went in solemn procession
annually, and offered the produce of the soil; flowers and fruits,
and the never-failing wine, and "mola salsa." Numa is said by Plutarch
to have introduced the custom into Italy, and one of his anathemas
is still preserved: "Qui terminum exarasit, ipsus et boves sacrei sunto."

father over his son was absolute, extending even to life and death, and
terminating only at the decease of one of the parties. Hence "peculium"
is put for the sum of money that a father allows a son, or a master a
slave, to have at his own disposal. But even this permission was revocable.
A soldier, who was sui juris, was allowed to name an heir in the
presence of three or four witnesses, and if he fell, this "nuda voluntas testatoris"
was valid. This privilege was extended by Julius Cæsar to those
who were "in potestate patris." "Liberam testandi factionem concessit,
D. Julius Cæsar: sed ea concessio temporalis erat: postea vero D. Titus
dedit: post hoc Domitianus: postea Divis Nerva plenissimam indulgentiam
in milites contulit: eamque et Trajanus secutus est." "Julius
Cæsar granted them the free power of making a will; but this was only
a temporary privilege. It was renewed by Titus and Domitian. Nerva
afterward bestowed on them full powers, which were continued to them
by Trajan." Vid. Ulpian, 23, § 10. The old Schol., however, says this
privilege was confined to the "peculium Castrense;" but he is probably
mistaken.</p></div>

Here the Satire terminates abruptly. The conclusion is too tame to
be such as Juvenal would have left it, even were the whole subject
thoroughly worked up. It is probably an unfinished draught. The
commentators are nearly equally balanced as to its being the work of
Juvenal or not; but one or two of the touches are too masterly to be by
any other hand.</p>

and the Bœotian ridges. It is the highest mountain in Central
Greece, and is covered with snow during the greater portion of the year.
The Castalian spring is fed by these perpetual snows, and pours down the
chasm between the two summits. These are two lofty rocks rising perpendicularly
from Delphi, and obtained for the mountain the epithet
δικόρυφον. Eur., Phœn., 234. They were anciently known by the names
of Hyampeia and Naupleia, Herod., viii., 39, but sometimes the name
Phædriades was applied to them in common. The name of Tithorea was
also applied to one of them, as well as to the town of Neon in its neighborhood.

<h3>SATIRE I.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Under the color of declaring his purpose of writing Satire and the plan he
intends to adopt, and of defending himself against the idle criticism of an
imaginary and nameless adversary, Persius lashes the miserable poets of
his own day, and in no very obscure terms, their Coryphæus himself,
Nero. The subject of the Satire is not very unlike the first of the second
book of Horace's Satires, and comes very near in some points to the first
Satire of Juvenal. But the manner of treatment is distinct in each, and
quite characteristic of the three great Satirists. Horace's is more full of
personality, one might say, of egotism, and his own dislike and contempt
of the authors of his time, more lively and brilliant, more pungent and
witty, than either of the others; more pregnant with jokes, and yet rising
to a higher tone than the Satire of Persius. That of Juvenal is in a more
majestic strain, as befits the stern censor of the depraved morals of his
day; full of commanding dignity and grave rebuke, of fiery indignation
and fierce invective; and is therefore more declamatory and oratorical in
its style, more elevated in its sentiment, more refined in its diction. While
in that of Persius we trace the workings of a young and ardent mind, devoted
to literature and intellectual pleasures, of a philosophical turn, and
a chastened though somewhat fastidious taste. We see the student and
devotee of literature quite as much as the censor of morals, and can see
that he grieves over the corruption of the public <em>taste</em> almost as deeply as
over the general depravity of public <em>morals</em>. Still there breathes through
the whole a tone of high and right feeling, of just and stringent criticism,
of keen and pungent sarcasm, which deservedly places this Satire very
high in the rank of intellectual productions.</p>

<p>The Satire opens with a dialogue between the poet himself and some one
who breaks in upon his meditations. This person is usually described as
his "Monitor;" some well-meaning acquaintance, who endeavors to dissuade
the poet from his purpose of writing Satire. But D'Achaintre's notion,
that he is rather an ill-natured critic than a good-natured adviser,
seems the more tenable one, and the divisions of the first few lines have
been ingeniously made to support that view. After expressing supreme
contempt for the poet's opening line, he advises him, if he must needs
give vent to verse, to write something more suited to the taste and spirit
of the age he lives in. Persius acknowledges that this would be the more
likely way to gain applause, but maintains that such approbation is not
the end at which a true poet ought to aim. And this leads him to expose
the miserable and corrupt taste of the poetasters of his day, and to express
supreme contempt for the mania for recitation then prevalent, which had
already provoked the sneers of Horace, and afterward drew down the
more majestic condemnation of Juvenal. He draws a vivid picture of
these depraved poets, who pander to the gross lusts of their hearers by
their lascivious strains. Their affectation of speech and manner, their
costly and effeminate dress, the vanity of their exalted seat, and the degraded
character of their compositions; and on the other hand, the excessive
and counterfeited applause of their hearers, expressed by extravagance
of language and lasciviousness of gesture corresponding to the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the compositions, are touched with a masterly hand. He then ridicules
the pretensions of these courtly votaries of the Muses, whose vanity is
fostered by the interested praise of dependents and sycophants, who are
the first to ridicule them behind their backs. He then makes a digression
to the bar; and shows that the manly and vigorous eloquence of Cicero
and Hortensius and Cato, as well as the masculine energy and dignity
of Virgil, is frittered away, and diluted by the introduction of redundant
and misplaced metaphor, labored antitheses, trifling conceits, accumulated
epithets, and bombastic and obsolete words, and a substitution
of rhetorical subtleties for that energetic simplicity which speaks <em>from</em>
and <em>to</em> the heart. Returning to the poets, he brings in a passage of Nero's
own composition as a most glaring example of these defects. This excites
his friend's alarm, and elicits some cautious advice respecting the
risk he encounters; which serves to draw forth a more daring avowal of
his bold purpose, and an animated description of the persons whom he
would wish to have for his readers.</p></div>

himself as having meditated on all mundane things, and, like Solomon,
having discovered their emptiness, "Vanitas vanitatum!" Cf.
Juv., Sat. i., 85, "Quidquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,

the reproaches of his brother-in-law Polydamas, and the Trojan men and
women, if he were to retire within the walls of Troy. Il., x., 105, 108,
Πουλυδάμας μοι πρῶτος ἐλεγχείην ἀναθήσει&mdash;αἰδέομαι Τρῶας καὶ Τρωάδας
ἑλκεσιπέπλους. Cicero has introduced the same lines in his Epistle
to Atticus: "Aliter sensero? αἰδέομαι non Pompeium modo, sed Τρῶας
καὶ Τρωάδας· Πουλυδάμας μοι πρῶτος ἐλεγχείην ἀναθήσει: Quis? Tu
ipse scilicet; laudator et scriptorum et factorum meorum," vii., 1. By
Polydamas, he intends Nero; by Troïades, the effeminate Romans, who
prided themselves on their Trojan descent. Cf. Juv., i., 100, "Jubet a
præcone vocari ipsos Trojugenas." viii., 181, "At vos Trojugenæ vobis
ignoscitis, et quæ turpia cerdoni Volesos Brutosque decebunt." Attius
Labeo was a miserable court-poet, a favorite of Nero, who applied himself
to translate Homer word for word. Casaubon gives the following specimen
of his poetry: "Crudum manduces Priamum, Priamique pisinnos."</p></div>

from thick, troubled waters. Persius now addresses himself, and uses
the second person. "Though Rome in its perverted judgment should
disparage my writings, I will not subscribe to its verdict, or seek beyond
my own breast for rules to guide my course of action." <em>Elevet</em>, <em>examen</em>,
<em>trutina</em>, are all metaphors from a steelyard or balance. Trutina is the
aperture in the iron that supports the balance, in which the examen, i. e.,
the tongue (hasta, lingula), plays. Elevare is said of that which causes
the lanx of the balance to "kick the beam." Castigare is to set the
balance in motion with the finger, until, perfect equilibrium being obtained,
it settles down to a state of rest. Public taste being distorted, to
attempt to correct it would be as idle as to try to rectify a false balance
by merely setting the beam vibrating.</p></div>

on the faces and brows of old men. The allusion, therefore, is to the
taste of the Romans of Persius' days, for the rugged, uncouth, and antiquated
writing of their earlier poets. Nearly the same idea is expressed
by the word <em>verrucosa</em>, "full of warts, hard, knotty, horny." Cicero mentions
this play: "Quis Ennii Medeam, et Pacuvii Antiopam contemnat
et rejiciat," de Fin., i., 2. The remainder of the line is a quotation from
Pacuvius. The word <em>ærumna</em> was obsolete when Quintilian wrote.</p></div>

The epithets are all far-fetched, and the images preposterous.
The Bacchantes were called Mimallones from Mimas, a mountain in
Ionia. Bassareus was an epithet of Bacchus, from the fox's skin in
which he was represented: and the feminine form is here applied to
Agave: by the <em>vitulus</em>, Pentheus is intended: the Mænad guides the car
of Bacchus, drawn by spotted lynxes, not with reins, but with clusters of
ivy. "Could such verses be tolerated," Persius asks indignantly, "did

our veins? Verses which show no evidence of anxious thought and
careful labor, but flow as lightly from the lips as the spittle that drivels

<h3>SATIRE II.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>This Satire, as well as the tenth Satire of Juvenal, is based upon the Second
Alcibiades of Plato, which it closely resembles in arrangement as
well as sentiment.</p>

<p>The object is the same in all three; to set before as the real opinion which
all good and worthy men entertained, even in the days of Pagan blindness,
of the manner and spirit in which the deity is to be approached by
prayer and sacrifice, and holds up to reprobation and ridicule the groveling
and low-minded notions which the vulgar herd, besotted by ignorance
and blinded by self-interest, hold on the subject. While we admire the
logical subtlety with which Plato leads us to a necessary acknowledgment
of the justice of his view, and the thoroughly practical philosophy by
which Juvenal would divert men from indulging in prayers dictated by
mere self-interest, we must allow Persius the high praise of having compressed
the whole subject with a masterly hand into a few vivid and comprehensive
sentences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The Satire consists of three parts. The first is merely an introduction to
the subject. Taking advantage of the custom prevalent among the Romans
of offering prayers and victims, and receiving presents and congratulatory
addresses from their friends, on their birthday, Persius sends a
poetical present to his friend Plotius Macrinus, with some hints on the
true nature of prayer. He at the same time compliments him on his superiority
to the mass of mankind, and especially to those of his own rank,
in the view he took of the subject.</p>

<p>In the second part he exposes the vulgar errors and prejudices respecting
prayer and sacrifice, and shows that prayers usually offered are wrong,
1st, as to their <em>matter</em>, and 2dly, as to their <em>manner</em>: that they originate
in low and sordid views of self-interest and avarice, in ignorant superstition,
or the cravings of an inordinate vanity. At the same time he holds
up to scorn the folly of those who offer up costly prayers, the fulfillment
of which they themselves render impossible, by indulging in vicious and
depraved habits, utterly incompatible with the requests they prefer.
Lastly, he explains the origin of these sordid and worse than useless
prayers. They arise from the impious and mistaken notions formed by
men who, vainly imagining that the Deity is even such a one as themselves,
endeavor to propitiate his favor in the same groveling spirit, and
with the same unworthy offerings with which they would bribe the goodwill
of one weak and depraved as themselves; as though, in Plato's
words, an ἐμπορικὴ τέχνη had been established between themselves and
heaven. The whole concludes with a sublime passage, describing in
language almost approaching the dignity of inspired wisdom, the state
of heart and moral feeling necessary to insure a favorable answer to
prayers preferred at the throne of heaven.</p></div>

unhappy day, and to reckon up at the end of their lives how many happy
days they had passed. Plin., H. N., vii., 40. So Mart., ix., Ep. 53,

man from his birth, as some held, being coeval with the man himself.
The birthday was sacred to him; the offerings consisted of wine, flowers,
and incense. "Manum a sanguine abstinebant: ne die quâ ipsi lucem
accepissent, aliis demerent." Censor, a Varrone. Cf. Serv. ad
Virg., Geor., i., 302. Hor., ii., Ep. ii., 187, "Scit Genius natale comes
qui temperat astrum, naturæ deus humanæ, mortalis in unumquodque
caput;" and ii., Ep. i., 143, "Sylvanum lacte piabant, Floribus et vino
Genium memorem brevis ævi." Cf. Orell., in loc. On other days, they
offered bloody victims also to the Genius. "Cras Genium mero Curabis

"Ac primum purâ somnum tibi discute lymphâ." The ancients believed
that night itself, independently of any extraneous pollution, occasioned
a certain amount of defilement which must be washed away in pure water
at daybreak. Cf. Virg., Æn., viii., 69, "Nox Ænean somnusque reliquit.

as a most corrupt judge. Pro Cluent., vii., 24; in Verr., ii., 32. He
is said to have murdered his own wife, his brother, and his brother's wife.
Yet even to such a wretch as this, says Persius, you would not venture to
name the wishes you prefer to Jove. Cf. Sen., Ep. x., "Nunc quanta

was immediately called in to bury the body: every thing that had been
scorched by it was carefully collected and buried with it. A two-year
old sheep was then sacrificed, and an altar erected over the place and the
ground slightly inclosed round. Lucan., viii., 864, "Inclusum Tusco venerantur
cæspite fulmen." Hor., A. P., 471, "An triste bidental moverit
incestus." Juv., vi., 587, "Atque aliquis senior qui publica fulgura condit."
Ergenna, or Ergennas, is the name of some Tuscan soothsayer,
who gives his directions after inspecting the entrails; the termination
being Tuscan, as Porsenna, Sisenna, Perpenna, etc. Bidental is applied
indifferently to the place, the sacrifice, and the person. Bidens is properly
a sheep fit for sacrifice, which was so considered when two years old.
Hence bidens may be a corruption of biennis; or from bis and dens, because
at the age of two years the sheep has eight teeth, two of which
project far beyond the rest, and are the criterion of the animal's age.</p></div>

<h3>SATIRE III.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>In this Satire, perhaps more than in any other, we detect Persius' predilection
for the doctrines of the Stoics. With them the summum bonum was
"the sound mind in the sound body." To attain which, man must apply
himself to the cultivation of virtue, that is, to the study of philosophy.
He that does not can aspire to neither. Though unknown to himself, he
is laboring under a mortal disease, and though he fancies he possesses a
healthy intellect, he is the victim of as deep-seated and dangerous a delusion
as the recognized maniac. The object of the Satire is to reclaim the
idle and profligate young nobles of his day from their enervating and pernicious
habits, by the illustration of these principles.</p>

<p>The opening scene of the Satire presents us with the bedchamber where one
of these young noblemen, accompanied by some other youths probably of
inferior birth and station, is indulging in sleep many hours after the sun
has risen upon the earth. The entrance of the tutor, who is a professor
of the Stoical philosophy, disturbs their slumbers, and the confusion consequent
upon his rebuke, and the thin disguise of their ill-assumed zeal,
is graphically described. After a passionate outburst of contempt at their
paltry excuses, the tutor points out the irretrievable evils that will result
from their allowing the golden hours of youth to pass by unimproved:
overthrows all objections which are raised as to their position in life, and
competency of means rendering such vigorous application superfluous;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>and in a passage of solemn warning full of majesty and power, describes
the unavailing remorse which will assuredly hereafter visit those who
have so far quitted the rugged path that leads to virtue's heights, that all
return is hopeless. He then proceeds to describe the defects of his own
education; and the vices he fell into in consequence of these defects&mdash;vices
however which were venial in himself, as those principles which
would have taught him their folly were never inculcated in him. Whereas
those whom he addresses, from the greater care that has been bestowed
on their early training, are without apology for their neglect of these
palpable duties. Then with great force and vigor, he briefly describes the
proper pursuits of well-regulated minds; and looks down with contemptuous
scorn on the sneers with which vulgar ignorance would deride these
truths, too transcendent for their gross comprehension to appreciate. The
Satire concludes very happily with the lively apologue of a glutton; who,
in despite of all warning and friendly advice, perseveres even when his
health is failing, in such vicious and unrestrained indulgence, that he
falls at length a victim to his intemperance. The application of the moral
is simple. The mind that is destitute of philosophical culture is hopelessly
diseased, and the precepts of philosophy can alone effect a cure. He
that despises these, in vain pronounces himself to be of sound mind. On
the approach of any thing that can kindle the spark, his passions burst
into flame; and in spite of his boasted sanity, urge him on to acts that
would call forth the reprobation even of the maniac himself. The whole
Satire and its moral, as Gifford says, may be fitly summed up in the solemn
injunction of a wiser man than the schools ever produced: "Wisdom is
the principal thing: therefore get Wisdom."</p></div>

Vitruvius attribute the discovery to Anaximander. They were, however,
known in much earlier times in the East. Cf. 2 Kings, xx. Sun-dials

been is always of a much yellower color than the inner side of the skin;
hence "croceæ membrana tabellæ," Juv., vii., 23; though some think
that the color was produced by the oil of citron or cedar. (Plin., xiii., 5.
Cf. ad Sat. i., 43.) Leaves and the bark of trees were first used for writing
on; hence <em>folia</em> and <em>liber</em>: occasionally linen, or plates of metal or
stone; then paper was manufactured from the Cyperus papyrus, or Egyptian
flag. Plin., xii., 23; xiii., 11. When the Ptolemies stopped the exportation
of paper from Egypt, to prevent the library of Eumenes, king
of Pergamus, from rivaling that of Alexandria, parchment (Pergamenum)
was invented to serve as a substitute. Plin., x., 11, 21. Hieron., Ep. vii.,
2. Hor., Sat., II., iii., 2. The manufacturer of it was termed Membranarius.
The parchment was rendered smooth by rubbing with pumice, and
flattened with lead, and was capable of being made so thin, that we read
that the whole Iliad written on parchment was inclosed within a walnut-shell.
Plin., VII., xxi., 21. Quintilian says, "that wax tablets were best
suited for writing, as erasures could be so readily made; but that for
persons of weak sight parchment was much better; but that the rapid
flow of thought was checked by the constant necessity for dipping the pen
in the ink." Quint., x., 3. Cf. Catull., xxii., 6. Tibull., III., i., 9. They
used reeds (calamus, fistula, arundo) for writing on this, as is done to
the present day in the East. The best came from Egypt. "Dat chartis
habiles calamos Memphitica tellus." Mart., xiv., Ep. 38. Hor., A. P.,

antiquity. From its being universally used to season food, and from its
antiseptic properties, it has been always associated with notions of moral
purity, and, from forming a part of all sacrifices, acquired a certain degree
of sanctity; so that the mere placing salt on the table was supposed, in a
certain degree, to consecrate what was set on it. (Arnob., ii., 91, "Sacras
facitis mensas salinorum appositu.") Hence the salt-cellar became
an heir-loom, and descended from father to son. (Hor., ii., Od. xvi., 13,
"Vivitur parvo bene cui paternum splendet in mensâ tenui salinum.")
Even in the most frugal times, it formed part, sometimes the only piece,
of family-plate. Pliny says that the "salinum and patella were the only
vessels of silver Fabricius would allow," xxxiii., 12, 54; and in the greatest
emergencies, as e. g., <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 542, when all were called upon to sacrifice
their plate for the public service, the salt-cellar and paten were still
allowed to be retained. Liv., xxvi., 36, "Ut senatores salinum, patellamque
deorum causâ habere possint." Cf. Val. Max., IV., iv., 3, "In C.
Fabricii et Q. Æmilii Papi domibus argentum fuisse confiteor; uterque
enim patellam deorum et salinum habuit." Cf. Sat. v., 138.</p></div>

of a Tuscan descent. Cf. Hor., i., Od. i., 1; iii., Od. xxix., 1; i., Sat.
vi., 1. The vocatives "millesime," "trabeate," are put by antiptosis for
nominatives. For the trabea, see note on Juv., viii., 259, "trabeam et
diadema Quirini." It was properly the robe of kings, consuls, and augurs,
but was worn by the equites on solemn processions. These were of two
kinds, the transvectio and the censio. The former is referred to here. It
took place annually on the 15th of July (Idibus Quinctilibus), when all
the knights <em>rode</em> from the temple of Mars, or of Honor, to the Capitol,
dressed in the trabea and crowned with olive wreaths, and saluted as they
passed the censors, who were seated in front of the temple of Castor in the
forum. This custom was introduced by Q. Fabius, when censor, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span>
303. (Liv., ix., 46, fin. Aur. Vict., Vir. Illustr., 32.) It afterward fell
into disuse, but was revived by Augustus. (Suet., Vit., 38.) In the <em>censio</em>,
which took place every five years only, the equites <em>walked</em> in procession
before the censors, leading their horses; all whom the censors approved of
were ordered to lead along their horses (equos traducere); those who
had disgraced themselves, either by immorality, or by diminishing their
fortune, or neglecting to take care of their horses, were degraded from
the rank of equites by being ordered to sell their horses.</p></div>

one of the clients of Sejanus. Cicero also speaks of the Pinarii Nattæ
as patricians and nobles. De Divin., ii., xxi. (Cf. pro Mur., xxxv.
Att., iv., 8.) Horace uses the name for a gross person. "Ungor olivo
non quo fraudatis immundus Natta lucernis," i., Sat. vi., 124; and Juvenal
for a public robber, "Quum Pansa eripiat quidquid tibi Natta reliquit,"
Sat. viii., 95. He is here put for one so sunk in profligacy, with
heart so hardened, and moral sense so obscured by habitual vice, as to be
unable even to perceive the abyss in which he is plunged. Cf. Arist.,
Eth., ii., 5, 8. "Reason and revelation alike teach us the awful truth,
that sin exercises a deadening effect on the moral perception of right and
wrong. Ignorance may be pleaded as an excuse, but not that ignorance
of which man himself is the cause. Such ignorance is the result of willful
sin. This corrupts the moral sense, hardens the heart, destroys the power
of conscience, and afflicts us with judicial blindness, so that we actually
lose at last the power of seeing the things which belong unto our peace."

Venerem quærente secundos, semper <em>damnosi</em> subsiluere <em>Canes</em>." Juv.,
xiv., 4, "<em>Damnosa</em> senem juvat alea," The talus had four flat sides, the
two ends being rounded. The numbers marked on the sides were the
ace, "canis" or "unio" (Isid., Or. xviii., 65, only in later writers), the
trey, "ternio," the quater, "quaternio," and the sice, "senio," opposite
the ace. They played with four <em>tali</em>, and the best throw was when each
die presented a different face (μηδενὸς ἀστραγάλου πεσόντος ἴσῳ σχήματι,
Lucian, Am. Mart., xiv., Ep. 14, "Cum steterit nullus tibi vultu talus
eôdem"), i. e., when one was canis, another ternio, another quaternio,
and the fourth senio. This throw was called Venus, or jactus Venereus,
because Venus was supposed to preside over it. The worst throw was
when all came out aces; and there appears to have been something in
the make of the dice to render this the most common throw. This was
called Canis, or Canicula; as Voss says, because "like a dog it ate up
the unfortunate gambler who threw it." Ovid, A. Am., ii., 205, "Seu
jacies talos, victam ne pœna sequatur, Damnosi facito stent tibi sæpe
Canes." One way of playing is described (in Suet., Vit. August, c. 71) is
letter of Augustus to Tiberius. Each player put a denarius into the
pool for every single ace or sice he threw, and he who threw Venus swept
away the whole. There were probably many other modes of playing.
Cf. Cic., de Div., i., 13. The <em>tesseræ</em> were like our dice with six sides,
numbered from one to six, so that the numbers on the two opposite sides
always equaled seven. Cf. Bekker's Gallus, p. 499. Lucil., i., fr. 27.</p></div>

<h3>SATIRE IV.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Had Persius lived <em>after</em> instead of before Juvenal we might have imagined
that he had taken for the theme the noble lines in his eighth Satire,</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Or had he drawn from the fountains of inspired wisdom, that he had had
in his eye a passage of still more solemn import: "A sharp judgment
shall be to them that be in high places. For mercy will soon pardon the
meanest; but mighty men shall be mightily tormented." Wisdom, vi., 5.
Either of these passages might fairly serve as the argument of this Satire.
What, however, Persius really took as his model is the First Alcibiades
of Plato, and the imitation of it is nearly as close as is that of the Second
Alcibiades in the Second Satire. And the subject of his criticism is no
less a personage than Nero himself. The close analogy between Nero
and Alcibiades will be further alluded to in the notes. We must remember
that Nero was but seventeen years old when he was called to take the
reins of government, and was but three years younger than Persius himself.
The Satire was probably written before Nero had entirely thrown
off the mask; at all events, before he had given the full evidence which
he afterward did of the savage ferocity and gross licentiousness of his
true nature. There was enough indeed for the stern Satirist to censure;
but still a spark of something noble remaining, to kindle the hope that
the reproof might work improvement. In his First Satire he had ridiculed
his pretensions to the name of Poet; in this he exposes his inability
as a Politician. The Satire naturally and readily divides itself into three
parts. In the first he ridicules the misplaced ambition of those who covet
exalted station, and aspire to take the lead in state affairs, without possessing
those qualifications of talent, education, and experience, which
alone could fit them to take the helm of government; and who hold that
the adventitious privileges of high birth and ancient lineage can countervail
the enervating effects of luxurious indolence and vicious self-indulgence.
The second division of the subject turns on the much-neglected
duty of self-examination; and enforces the duty of uprightness and purity
of conduct from the consideration, that while it is hopeless in all to escape
the keen scrutiny that all men exercise in their neighbor's failings, while
they are at the same time utterly blind to their own defects, yet that men
of high rank and station must necessarily provoke the more searching
criticism, in exact proportion to the elevation of their position. He points
out also the policy of checking all tendency to satirize the weakness of
others, to which Nero was greatly prone, and in fact had already aspired
to the dignity of a writer of Satire; as such sarcasm only draws down
severer recrimination on ourselves. In the third part he reverts to the
original subject; and urges upon the profligate nobles of the day the duty
of rigid self-scrutiny, by reminding them of the true character of that
worthless rabble, on whose sordid judgment and mercenary applause they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
ground their claims to approbation. This love of the "aura popularis"
was Nero's besetting vice; and none could doubt for whom the advice
was meant. Yet the allusions to Nero throughout the Satire, transparent
as they must have been to his contemporaries, are so dexterously covered
that Persius might easily have secured himself from all charge of personally
attacking the emperor under the plea that his sole object was a declamatory

βουλεύεσθαι. The imitations of the First Alcibiades are very close
throughout the Satire. Even in our own day, in looking back upon
ancient history, it would be difficult to find two persons so nearly counterparts
of each other as Nero and Alcibiades; not only in their personal
character but in the adventitious circumstances of their life. Both came
into public life at a very early age. Nero was emperor before he was
seventeen years old, and Alcibiades was barely twenty at the siege of
Potidæa. Seneca was to Nero what Socrates was to Alcibiades. Both
derived their claims to pre-eminence from the <em>mother's</em> side: Nero through
Agrippina, from the Julian gens; Alcibiades through Dinomache, from
the Alemæonidæ. The public influence of both extended through nearly
the same period, thirteen years. Both were notorious for the same vices:
love of self-indulgence, ambition of pre-eminence, personal vanity, lawless
insolence toward others, lavish expenditure, and utter disregard of
all principle. It would be very easy to carry out the parallel into greater
detail. Comp. Suet., Nero, c. 26, with Grote's Greece, vol. vii., ch. 55.</p></div>

father, Clinias, having been killed at the battle of Coronea; when he
was placed with his younger brother Clinias, under the guardianship of
Pericles and his brother Ariphron, to whom his ungovernable passions,
even in his boyhood, were a source of great grief. Of this connection
Alcibiades was very proud. Cf. Plat., Alc., c. 1. Nero lost his father
when scarcely three years old; and at the age of eleven, he was adopted
by Claudius and placed under the care of Annæus Seneca. It is curious
that the first public act of both was an act of liberality to the people.
Compare the account of Nero's proposing the Congiarium (Suet., Nero,
c. 7), with the anecdote of the quail of Alcibiades told by Plutarch (in
Vit., c. 10). There is probably also a bitter sarcasm in the word "pupille,"
as it was the term of contempt applied to Nero by Poppæa, who was impatient
to be married to him, which the control of his mother Agrippina,
and the influence of Seneca and Burrhus, delayed. Cf. Tac., Ann., xiv.,
I, "Quæ (Poppæa) aliquando per facetias incusaret Principem et <em>pupillum</em>
vocaret qui jussis alienis obnoxius non modo imperii sed libertatis
etiam indigeret." Some imagine <em>pericli</em> to be intended as a pun, "One
that would prove <em>dangerous</em> hereafter;" as Alcibiades was compared to a
lion's whelp, Arist., Ran., 1431, οὐ χρὴ λέοντος σκύμνον ἐν πόλει τρέφειν
ἤν δ' ἐκτρέφῃ τις, τοῖς τρόποις ὑπηρετεῖν.</p></div>

and was hence used by critics to obelize passages they condemned or disapproved

Suetonius does not give a very unfavorable account of Nero's
exterior, "Staturâ fuit prope justâ, sufflavo capillo, vultu pulchro magis
quam venusto, oculis cæsiis." The rest of the picture is not quite so
flattering. It should be observed, by the way, that Suetonius speaks in
terms by no means disparaging of Nero's verses, which, he says, flowed
easily and naturally: he discards the insinuation that they were mere
translations, or plagiarisms, as he says he had ocular proof to the contrary.

roads meet, from the old verb bito or beto. At these places altars, or
little chapels, were erected with as many sides as there were ways meeting.
(Jani bifrontes.) Cf. v., 35, "Ramosa in compita." Hence they
are called "pertusa," i. e., <em>pervia</em>, "open in all directions." At these
chapels it was the custom for the rustics to suspend the worn-out implements
of husbandry. Though some think this was more especially done
at the Compitalia. This festival was one of those which the Romans
called Feriæ Conceptivæ, being fixed annually by the Prætor. They
generally followed close upon the Saturnalia, and were held sometimes
three days before the kalends of January, sometimes on the kalends
themselves. Vid. Cic., Pis., iv. Auson., Ecl. de Fev., "Et nunquam
certis redeuntia festa diebus, Compita per vicos quum sua quisque colit."
According to Servius, they are described, though not by name, by Virgil,
Æn., viii., 717. Like the Quinquatrus, they lasted only one day, and on
that occasion additional wooden chapels were erected, the sacrificial cakes
were provided by different houses, and slaves, not freedmen, presided at
the sacrifices. Vid. Plin., XXXVI., xxvii., 70. The gods whom they
worshiped are said to have been the Lares Compitales, of whom various
legends are current. But this is doubtful. Augustus appointed certain
rites in their honor, twice in the year. Suet., Vit., c. xxxi., "Compitales
Lares ornari bis anno instituit vernis floribus et æstivis." It seems
to have been a season of rustic revelry and feasting, and of license for
slaves, like the Saturnalia. The avarice of the miser, therefore, on such
an occasion, is the more conspicuous. His vessel is but a small one
(seriola), and its contents woolly (pannosam) with age (veterem); yet he
grudges scraping off the clay (limum) with which they used to stop their
vessels, in order to pour a libation of his sour wine.</p></div>

to be obscure; that while all would apply it in one sense to Nero,
Persius, if accused, might maintain that he intended only the other sense,
which the words at first sight bear." Puteal is put for the forum itself
by synecdoche. It is properly the "puteal Libonis," a place which L.
Scribonius Libo caused to be inclosed (perhaps cir. <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 604). It
had been perhaps a bidental (cf. ad Sat. ii., 27), or, as others say, the
place where the razor of the augur Nævius was deposited. Near it was
the prætor's chair, and the benches frequented by persons who had private
suits, among whom the class of usurers would be most conspicuous.
(Hence Hor., i., Epist. xix., 8, "Forum putealque Libonis Mandabo siccis."
ii., Sat. vi., 35.) <em>Puteal flagellare</em>, therefore, is taken in its primitive
sense to mean, "to frequent the forum for the purpose of enforcing rigorous
payment from those to whom you <em>have</em> lent money; or the benches
of the usurers, in quest of persons to whom you <em>may</em> lend it on exorbitant
interest." Cf. Ov., Remed., Am., 561, "Qui <em>puteal</em> Janumque timet,
celeresque Kalendas." Cic., Sext., 8. In its secondary sense, it may
apply to the nightly atrocities of Nero, who used to frequent the forum,
violently assaulting those he met, and outrageously insulting females, not
unfrequently committing robberies and even murder; but having been
soundly beaten one night by a nobleman whose wife he had outraged,
he went ever after attended by gladiators, as a security for his personal
safety; who kept aloof until their services were required. Nero might
well, therefore, be called the "scourge of the Forum," and be said
to leave scars and wales behind him in the scenes of his enormities.
Juvenal (Sat. iii., 278, <em>seq.</em>) alludes to the same practices. A description
of them at full length may be found in Tacitus (Ann., xiii., 26) and Suetonius

<h3>SATIRE V.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>On this Satire, which is the longest and the best of all, Persius may be said
to rest his claims to be considered a Philosopher and a Poet. It may be
compared with advantage with the Third Satire of the second book of
Horace. As the object in that is to defend what is called the Stoical paradox,
"that none but the Philosopher is of <em>sound mind</em>,"</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cæecum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Autumat:" i., 43-45,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>so here, Persius maintains that other dogma of the Stoics, "that none but
the Philosopher is truly a <em>free</em> man." Horace argues (in the person of a
Stoic) that there can be but <em>one</em> path that leads in the right direction; all
others must lead the traveler only farther astray. "Unus utrique error
sed variis illudit partibus" (ἐσθλοὶ μὲν γάρ ἁπλῶς, παντοδαπῶς δὲ κακοί.
Arist., Eth., II., vi., 4). So Persius argues, whatever are the varied pursuits
of different minds, he that is under the influence of some overwhelming
passion, can offer no claim to be accounted a free agent. "Mille hominum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>species, et rerum discolor usus." (52.) In fact, if we substitute "freedom"
for "wisdom," the whole argument of the last part of the Satire may be expressed
in the two lines of Horace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i32">"Quisquis<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Ambitione</em> malâ aut <em>argenti</em> pallet amore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quisquis <em>Luxuria</em> tristive <em>Superstitione</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aut alio mentis morbo calet:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that man can neither be pronounced free or of sound mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="hangindent">

<p>The Satire consists of two parts; the first serving as a Proëm to the other.
It is, in fact, the earnest expression of unbounded affection for his tutor
and early friend Annæus Cornutus, from whom he had imbibed those
principles of philosophy, which it is the object of the latter part of the
Satire to elucidate. After a few lines of ridicule at the hackneyed prologues
of the day, he puts into the mouth of Cornutus that just criticism
of poetical composition which there is very little doubt Persius had in reality
derived from his master; and in answer to this, he takes occasion to
profess his sincere and deep-seated love and gratitude toward the preceptor,
whose kind care had rescued him from the vicious courses to which
a young and ardent temperament was leading him; and whose sound
judgment and dexterous management had weaned him from the temptations
that assail the young, by making him his own companion in those
studies which expanded his intellect while they rectified the <em>obliquity</em> (to
use the Stoics' phrase) of his moral character. Such mutual affection, he
urges, could only exist between two persons whom something more than
mere adventitious circumstances drew together; and he therefore concludes
that the same natal star must have presided over the horoscope of
both.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to the main subject of the Satire, viz., that all men should
aim at attaining that freedom which can only result from that perfect
"soundness of mind" which we have shown to be the summum bonum of
the Stoics. This real freedom no mere external or adventitious circumstances
can bestow. Dama, though freed at his master's behest, if he be
the slave of passion, is as much a slave as if he had never felt the prætor's
rod. Until he have really cast off, like the snake, the slough of his former
vices, and become changed in heart and principles as he is in political
standing, he is so far from being really free from bondage that he can not
rightly perform even the most trivial act of daily life. True freedom consists
in virtue alone; but "Virtus est vitium fugere:" and he who eradicates
all other passions, but cherishes still one darling vice, has but changed
his master. The dictates of the passions that sway his breast are more
imperious than those of the severest task-master. Whether it be avarice,
or luxury, or love, or ambition, or superstition, that is the dominant principle,
so long as he can not shake himself free from the control of these,
he is as much, as real a slave as the drudge that bears his master's strigil
to the bath, or the dog that fancies he has burst his bonds while the
long fragment of his broken chain still dangles from his neck. The last
few lines contain a dignified rebuke of the sneers which such pure sentiments
as these would provoke in the coarse minds of some into whose
hands these lines might fall; perhaps, too, they may be meant as a gentle
reproof of the sly irony in which the Epicurean Horace indulged, while
professing to enunciate the Stoic doctrine, that none but the true Philosopher
can be said to be of sound mind.</p></div>

error, ignorant of the purpose of life, makes anxious minds

Seneca) was distinguished as a tragic poet as well as a Stoic philosopher.
He was a native of Leptis, in Africa, and came to Rome in the reign of
Nero, where he applied himself with success to the education of young
men. He wrote on Philosophy, Rhetoric, and a treatise entitled ἡ ἑλληνικὴ
θεολογία. Persius, at the age of sixteen (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 50), placed himself
under his charge, and was introduced by him to Lucan; and at his death
left him one hundred sestertia and his library. Cornutus kept the books,
to the number of seven hundred, but gave back the money to Persius'
sisters. Nero, intending to write an epic poem on Roman History, consulted
Cornutus among others; but when the rest advised Nero to extend
it to four hundred books, Cornutus said, "No one would read them."
For this speech Nero was going to put him to death; but contented himself
with banishing him. This took place, according to Lubinus, four
years after Persius' death; more probably in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 65, when so many of
the Annæan gens suffered. (Cf. Clinton in Ann.) Vid. Suid., p. 2161.

day as to choice of subjects, style, and language, Cornutus proceeds to
compliment Persius for the exactly contrary merits. First, for the use
of words not removed from ordinary use, but such as were in use in the
most elegant and polished society of Rome, as distinguished from the
rude archaisms then in vogue, or the too familiar vulgarisms of the
tunicatus popellus in the provinces, where none assumed the toga till he
was carried out to burial. (Juv., Sat. iii, 172.) But then, according
to Horace's precept ("Dixeris egregiè si notum callida verbum reddiderit
junctura novum," A. P., 47), grace and dignity was added to these
by the novelty of effect produced by judicious combination. Cf. Cic.,
de Orat., iii., 43. There is an allusion to the same metaphor as in Sat.
i., 65, "Per leve severos effundat junctura ungues."</p></div>

reciting, suited to compositions in a familiar style." Cicero uses <em>teres</em> in
the same sense. De Orat., iii., c. 52, "Plena quædam, sed tamen teres,
et tenuis, non sine nervis ac viribus." Horace, A. P., 323, "Graiis dedit

serve as a protection to the youths that wore it. The purple with which
the toga was bordered was to remind them of the modesty which was
becoming to their early years. It was laid aside by boys at the age of
seventeen, and by girls when they were married. The assumption of the
toga virilis took place with great solemnities before the images of the
Lares, sometimes in the Capitol. It not unfrequently happened that the
changing of the toga at the same time formed a bond of union between
young men, which lasted unbroken for many years. Hor., i., Od. xxxvi.,
9, "Memor Actæ non alio rege puertiæ Mutatæque simul togæ. "The
Liberalia, on the 16th before the Kalends of April (i. e., March 17th),
were the usual festival for this ceremony. Vid. Cic. ad Att., VI., i., 12.

Cethegis." The Lares, being the original household deities, were regarded
with singular affection, and were probably usually represented in the
homely dress of the early ages of the republic. Perhaps, too, some superstitious
feeling might tend to prevent any innovation in their costume.
This method of wearing the toga, which consisted in twisting it over the
left shoulder, so as to leave the right arm bare and free, was called the
"Cinctus Gabinus" (cf. Ov., Fast., v., 101, 129), from the fact of its
having been adopted at the sudden attack at Gabii, when they had not
time to put on the sagum, but were forced to fight in the toga. Hence,
in proclaiming war, the consul always appeared in this costume (Virg.,
Æn., vii., 612, "Ipse Quirinali trabeâ cinctuque Gabino Insignis reserat
stridentia limina Consul"), and it was that in which Decius devoted himself.

in one of the tribes, in order that he might enjoy the full privileges
of a Roman citizen: one of the chief of these was the frumentatio, i. e.,
the right of receiving a ticket which entitled him to his share at the distribution
of the public corn, which took place on the nones of each
month. This ticket or tally was of wood or lead, and was transferable.
Sometimes a small sum was paid with it. Cf. Juv., vii., 174, "Summula
ne pereat quâ vilis tessera venit frumenti." The slave generally adopted
the prænomen of the person who manumitted him, and the name of
the tribe to which he was admitted was added. This prænomen was the
distinguishing mark of a freeman, and they were proportionally proud
of it. (Hor., ii., Sat. v., 32, "Quinte, puta, aut Publi&mdash;gaudent prænomine
molles auriculæ." Juv., v., 127, "Si quid tentaveris unquam
hiscere tanquam habeas tria nomina.") The tribe "Velina" was one
of the country tribes, in the Sabine district, and called from the Lake
Velinus. It was the last tribe added, with the Quirina, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 512, to
make up the thirty-five tribes, by the censors C. Aurelius Cotta and M.
Fabius Buteo. Vid. Liv., Epit., xix. Cic., Att., iv., 15. The name of
the tribe was always added in the ablative case, as Oppius Veientinâ,

free: 1, per Censum; 2, per Vindictam; 3, per Testamentum. The
second is alluded to here. The master took the slave before the prætor
or consul and said, "Hunc hominem liberum esse volo jure Quiritium."
Then the prætor, laying the rod (Vindicta) on the slave's head, pronounced
him free; whereupon his owner or the lictor turned him round,
gave him a blow on the cheek (alapa), and let him go, with the words,
"Liber esto atque ito quo voles." (Plaut., Men., V., vii., 40.)</p></div>

Sambuca is from the Chaldaic Sabbecà. It was a kind of triangular
harp with four strings, and according to the Greeks, was called from one
Sambuces, who first used it. Others say the Sibyl was the first performer
on it. Ibycus of Regium was its reputed inventor, as Anacreon of
the Barbiton: but from its mention in the book of Daniel (iii., 5), it was
probably of earlier date. A female performer on it was called Sambucistria.
An instrument of war, consisting of a platform or drawbridge
supported by ropes, to let down from a tower on the walls of a besieged
town, was called, from the similarity of shape, by the same name. Cf.
Athen., iv., 175; xiv., 633, 7. (Suidas, in voce, seems to derive it from

and of all forms of it, there was none which both Juvenal and Persius
regarded with greater contempt and abhorrence than that of the Jews:
and next to this they ranked the Egyptian. From the favor shown to
the Herods by the Roman emperors, from Julius Cæsar downward, it is
not wonderful that the partisans of Herod, or Herodians, should form a
large body at Rome as well as in Judæa; and that consequently the birthday
of Herod should be kept as "a convenient day" for displaying that
regard (compare Acts, xii., 21 with Matt., xiv., 6, and Mark, vi., 21), and
be celebrated with all the solemnities of a sabbath. It was the custom
(as we have seen, Juv., xii., 92), on occasions of great rejoicing, to cover
the door-posts and fronts of the houses with branches and flowers, among
which violets were very conspicuous (Juv., <em>u. s.</em>), and to suspend lighted
lamps even at a very early hour from the windows, and trees near the
house. (So Tertull., Apol., "Lucernis diem infringere." Lactant., vi.,
2, "Accendunt lumina velut in tenebris agenti.") The sordid poverty of
the Jews is as much the satirist's butt as their superstition. The lamps
are greasy, the fish of the coarsest kind, and of that only the worst part,
the tail, serves for their banquet, which is also served in the commonest
earthenware.</p></div>

be instituted. This was therefore done, and three days were kept in May
(the 7th, 5th, and 3d before the Ides) under the name of Remuria or
Lemuria. They were kept at night, during which time they went with
bare feet, washed their hands thrice, and threw black beans nine times
behind their backs, which ceremonies were supposed to deliver them
from the terrors of the Lemures. During these days all the temples of
the gods were kept strictly closed, and all marriages contracted in the
month of May were held inauspicious. Ov., Fast., v., 421-92. Hor.,

<h3>SATIRE VI.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>There are few points on which men <em>practically</em> differ more than on the question,
What is the right use of riches? On this head there was as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>diversity of opinion among the philosophers of old as in the present day.
Some maintaining that not only a virtuous, but also a happy life consisted
in the absence of all those external aids that wealth can bestow; others
as zealously arguing that a competency of means was absolutely necessary
to the due performance of the higher social virtues. The source of
error in most men lies in their mistaking the means for the end; and the
object of this Satire, which is the most original, and perhaps the most
pleasing of the whole, is to point out how a proper employment of the
fortune that falls to our lot may be made to forward the best interests of
man. Persius begins with a warm encomium on the genius and learning
of his friend Cæsius Bassus, the lyric poet; especially complimenting him
on his antiquarian knowledge, and versatility of talent: and he then proceeds
to show, by setting forth his own line of conduct, how true happiness
may be attained by avoiding the extremes of sordid meanness on the one
hand, and ostentatious prodigality on the other; by disregarding the suggestions
of envy and the dictates of ambition. A prompt and liberal regard
to the necessities and distresses of others is then inculcated; for this,
coupled with the maintenance of such an establishment as our fortune
warrants us in keeping up, is, to use the words of the poet, "to <em>use</em> wealth,
not to abuse it." He then proceeds with great severity and bitter sarcasm
to expose the shallow artifices of those who attempt to disguise their sordid
selfishness under the specious pretense of a proper prudence, a reverence
for the ancient simplicity and frugality of manners, and a proper regard
for the interests of those who are to succeed to our inheritance. The Satire
concludes with a lively and graphic conversation between Persius and his
imaginary heir, in which he exposes the cupidity of those who are waiting
for the deaths of men whom they expect to succeed; and shows that the
anxiety of these for the death of their friends, furnishes the strongest motive
for a due indulgence in the good things of this life; which it would
be folly to hoard up merely to be squandered by the spendthrift, or feed
the insatiable avarice of one whom even boundless wealth could never
satisfy. This Satire was probably written, as Gifford says, "while the
poet was still in the flower of youth, possessed of an independent fortune,
of estimable friends, dear connections, and of a cultivated mind, under
the consciousness of irrecoverable disease; a situation in itself sufficiently
affecting, and which is rendered still more so by the placid and even cheerful
spirit which pervades every part of the poem."</p></div>

and study, used to begin their lucubrations about the time of the
Vulcanalia, which were held on the 23d of August (x. Kal. Sept.), and
for this purpose usually returned from Rome to their country houses.
Pliny, describing the studious habits of his uncle, says (iii., Ep. 5), "Sed
erat acre ingenium, incredibile studium, summa vigilantia. Lucubrare
a Vulcanalibus incipiebat, non auspicandi causâ sed studendi, statim a
nocte." So Horace, i., Ep. vii., 10, "Quod si <em>bruma</em> nives Albanis illinet
agris, Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet Contractusque leget."
He gives the reason, ii., Ep. ii., 77, "Scriptorum chorus omnis amat
nemus et fugit urbem." Cf. Juv., vii., 58. Plin., i., Ep. 9.</p></div>

the same, as the rough, hardy, masculine virtues of the ancient Romans
were attributed to Sabine training and institutions. Tetricus, or Tetrica,
was a hill in the Sabine district. Virg., Æen., vii., 712, "Qui Tetricæ
horrentis rupes, montemque severum Casperiamque colunt." Liv., i.,
18, "Suopte igitur ingenio temperatum animum virtutibus fuisse opinor
magis; instructumque non tam peregrinis artibus quam disciplina <em>tetricâ</em>
ac tristi veterum Sabinorum: quo genere nullum quondam incorruptius
fuit." Ov., Am., III., viii., 61, "Exæquet <em>tetricas</em> licet illa Sabinas."

supposes Bassus to have been the author of a Theogony or Cosmogony.
He is said, on the authority of Terentianus Maurus and Priscian, to have
written a book on Metres, dedicated to Nero. Those who read "vocum,"
suppose that Persius meant to imply that he successfully transferred
to his Odes the nervous words of the older dialects of his country.</p></div>

The town of Luna, now Luni, is in Etruria, but only separated by the
river Macra (now Magra) from Liguria. The Lunai Portus, now Golfo
di Spezzia, is in Liguria, and was the harbor from which the Romans
usually took shipping for Corsica and Sardinia. Ennius therefore must
have known it well, from often sailing thence with the elder Cato.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1518_1518" id="Footnote_1518_1518"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1518_1518"><span class="label">[1518]</span></a> <em>Cor Ennii.</em> "Cor" is frequently used for sense. It is here a periphrasis
for "Ennius in his senses." Quintus Ennius was born <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 239,
at Rudiæ, now Rugge, in Calabria, near Brundusium, and was brought
to Rome from Sardinia by Cato when quæstor there <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 204. He lived
in a very humble way on Mount Aventine, and died <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 169, of gout
(morbus articularis), and was buried in Scipio's tomb on the Via Appia.
He held the Pythagorean doctrine of Metempsychosis, and says himself,
in the beginning of his Annals, that Homer appeared to him in a dream,
and told him that he had once been a peacock, and that his soul was
transferred to him. The fragment describing this is extant. "Transnavit
cita per teneras Caliginis auras (anima Homeri) visus Homerus
adesse poeta. Tum memini fieri me pavum." [Cf. Hor., ii., Ep. i., 50.
"Ennius et sapiens et fortis et <em>alter Homerus</em>, Ut critici dicunt, leviter
curare videtur Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea." Tertull., de
An., 24, "Pavum se meminit Homerus, Ennio Somniante."] The interpretation
in the text seems the most reasonable. Others take <em>quintus</em> as
a numeral adjective, and explain the meaning to be, that the soul of a
peacock transmigrated first into Euphorbus, then into Homer, then into
Pythagoras, and then into Ennius, who was consequently fifth from the
peacock.</p></div>

follows. Varro, L. L., viii., 38, says the <em>feminine</em> form is not Latin. The
"turdus" (Greek κίχλη), probably like our "field-fare," was esteemed
the greatest delicacy by the Greeks and Romans. In the Nubes of Aristophanes,
the λόγος δίκαιος says, "In former days young men were not
allowed οὐδ' ὀψοφαγεῖν, οὐδὲ κιχλίζειν." (Ubi vid. Schol.; but cf. Theoc.,

bird by the flavor would be the acme of Epicurism. Hor., i., Ep. xv.,

not genuine." Another interpretation is, "effeminate, emasculate,
void of manly vigor and energy," from the supposed enervating effect
of Greek philosophy on the masculine character of the Romans of
other days. A third explanation is, "that which has experienced the
sea," from the <em>active</em> sense of expers, and therefore is simply equivalent
to "foreign, or imported." Casaubon seems to incline to the latter
view.</p></div>

as Imperator. His lictors then wreathed their fasces, and his soldiers
their spears, with bays, and then he sent letters wreathed with bays (literæ
laureatæ) to the senate, and demanded a triumph. If the senate approved,
they decreed a thanksgiving (supplicatio) to the gods. The
bays were worn by himself and his soldiers till the triumph was over.
(Branches of bay were set up before the gate of Augustus, by a decree
of the senate, as being the perpetual conqueror of his enemies. Cf. Ov.,
Trist., III., i., 39.) These letters were very rare under the emperors, vid.
Tac., Agric., xviii., except those sent by the emperors themselves. Mart.,

for a legatee to refuse to administer to the estate of the testator. Persius
says, "even though you refuse to act as my heir, I shall have no great
difficulty in finding some one who will. Though I have spent large sums
in largesses to the mob, and in honor of the emperor, I have still a field
left near the city, which many would gladly take." Such is unquestionably
the drift of the passage; but "exossatus" is variously explained.
It literally means that from which the bones have been taken: vid. Plaut.,
Aul., II., ix., 2, "Murænam exdorsua, atque omnia exossata fac sient."
Amph., I., i., 163. So Lucr., iv., 1267. Ter., Ad., III., iv., 14. As
stones are "the bones of the earth" (Ov., Met., i., 393, "Lapides in corpore
terræ ossa reor"), it may mean "thoroughly cleared from stones;"
or, as Casaubon says, so thoroughly exhausted by constant cropping, that
the land is reduced to its very bones (as Juv., viii., 90, "Ossa vides regum
vacuis exhausta medullis"). "Yet even this field, bad as it is, some terræ
filius may be found to take." <em>Juxta</em> is generally explained "near
Rome," and therefore parted with <em>last</em>. D'Achaintre takes it with exossatus
in the sense of "almost."</p></div>

by Æsculapius to life. Cf. Ov., Met., xv., 543. Virg., Æn., vii., 760-782.

Athens. There were three festivals of this kind, according to Suidas, the
Panathenæan, Hephæstian, and Promethean. In the latter they ran from
the altar of Prometheus through the Ceramicus to the city. The object
of the runners in these races was to carry a lighted torch to the end of
their courses. But the manner of the running is a disputed point among
the commentators. Some say three competitors started together, and he
that carried his torch unextinguished to the goal was victorious. Others
say the runners were stationed at different intervals, and the first who
started gave up his torch at the first station to another, who took up the
running, and in turn delivering it to a third; and to this the words of
Lucretius seem to refer, ii., 77, "Inque brevi spatio mutantur sæcla animantúm
Et quasi cursores vitaï lampada tradunt." Others again think
that several competitors started, but one only bore a torch, which, when
wearied, he delivered to some better-winded rival; which view is supported
by Varro, R. R., iii., 16, "In palæstra qui tædas ardentes accipit,
celerior est in cursu continuo quam ille qui tradit: propterea quod defatigatus
cursor dat integro facem." Cic., Heren., 4. The explanations of
this line consequently are almost as various. Prate, the Delphin editor,
supposes that Persius' heir was a man farther advanced in years than
Persius himself. Gifford explains it, "You are in full health, and have
every prospect of outstripping me in the career of life; do not then prematurely
take from me the chance of extending my days a little. Do
not call for the torch before I have given up the race:" and sees in it a
pathetic conviction of Persius' own mind, that his health was fast failing,
and that a fatal termination of the contest was inevitable and not far remote.
D'Achaintre thinks, with Casaubon, that "qui prior es" means,
"You are my nearer heir than the imaginary Manius, why therefore do
you disturb yourself? Receive my inheritance, as all legacies should be
received, i. e., as unexpected gifts of fortune; as treasures found on the
road, of which Mercurius is the supposed giver. I am then your Mercury.
Imagine me to be your god of luck, coming, as he is painted, with
a purse in my hand." Cf. Hor., ii., Sat. iii., 68.</p></div>

was a great emporium for slaves. Cic., Post. Red., "Cappadocem

39, "Mancipiis locuples eget æris Cappadocum rex." The royal property,
consisting chiefly in slaves, was kept in different fortresses throughout
the country. The whole nation might be said to be addicted to
servitude; for when they were offered a free constitution by the Romans,
they declined the favor, and preferred receiving a master from the hand
of their allies. Strabo, xii., p. 540. After the conquest of Pontus, Rome
and Italy were filled with Cappadocian slaves, many of whom were excellent
bakers and confectioners. Vid. Plutarch v. Lucullus. Athen.,

<h2>SULPICIA.</h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The occasion of the following Satire is generally known as "the
expulsion of the philosophers from Rome by Domitian." As the
same thing took place under Vespasian also, it becomes worth while
to inquire who are the persons intended to be included under this
designation; and in what manner the fears of the two emperors
could be so worked upon as to pass a sweeping sentence of banishment
against persons apparently so helpless and so little formidable
as the peaceful cultivators of philosophy. It seems not improbable
then that the fears both of Vespasian and Domitian were of a <em>personal</em>
as well as of a political nature. We find that in both cases
the "Mathematici" are coupled with the "Philosophi." Now these
persons were no more nor less than pretenders to the science of
judicial astrology [cf. Juv., iii., 43; vi., 562; xiv., 248; Suet., Cal.,
57; Tit., 9; Otho, 4; Gell., i., 9]; and to what an extent those who
were believed to possess this knowledge were dreaded in those days
of gross superstition, may be easily inferred by merely looking into
Juvenal's sixth and Persius' fifth Satire. Besides the baleful effects
of incantations, which were sources of terror even in Horace's days,
the mere possession by another of the nativity of a person whose
death might be an object of desire to the bearer, was supposed, at
the time of which we are now speaking, to be a sufficient ground
of serious alarm. We are not surprised therefore to find it recorded
as an instance of great generosity on the part of Vespasian, that on
one occasion he pardoned one Metius Pomposianus, although he was
informed that he had in his possession a "Genesis Imperatoria;"
or that the possession of a similar document with regard to Domitian
cost the owner his life. (Cf. Suet., Vesp., 14; Domit., 10.)
With regard to the philosophers, it appears that the followers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the Stoic school were those against whom the edict was especially
directed. Not only did the tenets of this school inculcate that independence
of thought and manners most directly at variance with
the servility and submissiveness inseparable from a state of thraldom
under a despot; but the cultivation of this branch of philosophy
was held to be nothing more than a specious cover for an attachment
to the freedom of speech and action enjoyed under the republican
form of government: and philosophy was accounted only
another name for revolution and rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a></p>

<p>The story told of Demetrius the Cynic, in Dio (lxvi., 13), and
confirmed by Suetonius (Vesp., c. 13), illustrates this view of the
subject. (Cf. Tac., Hist., iv., 40.) It appears to have been at the
suggestion of Mucianus,<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> that all philosophers, but especially the
Stoics, were banished from Rome; and that the celebrated Musonius
Rufus was the only one who was suffered to remain. This
took place <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 74. Sixteen years after this we find a decree of
the senate passed to a similar effect. Now, as philosophy may be
studied equally well any where, there seems no reason why, if it
were not in some way connected with their <em>political</em> creed, all these
votaries of Stoicism should in the interim have taken up their abode
at Rome. And though, no doubt, the unoffending may have suffered
with the guilty, the history of the edict seems pretty plainly
to show what <em>particular doctrines</em> of their philosophy were so obnoxious
to Domitian. Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio all agree in the
cause assigned for the sentence: viz., that Julius Arulenus Rusticus
and Herennius Senecio had been enthusiastic in their praises of
Thrasea Pætus and Helvidius Priscus; and that <em>therefore</em> "all philosophers
were removed from Rome." ("Cujus criminis occasione
philosophos omnes Urbe Italiâque submovit." Suet., Domit., 10.
Cf. Tac., Agric, 2; Dio, lxvii., 13.) But it was for their undisguised
hatred of tyrants, and for no dogma of the schools, that the former
of these was put to death by Nero, and the latter by Vespasian.
Both of them, as we know, celebrated with no ordinary festivities
the birthdays of the Bruti (Juv., v., 36); and Helvidius, even while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>prætor, went so far as to omit all titles of honor or distinction before
the name of Vespasian. (Suet., Vesp., 15.) We must not
therefore fall into the common error of supposing this "banishment
of philosophers" to have been a mere act of wanton, senseless
tyranny, or of brutal ignorance. Even by his enemies' showing,
the opening scenes of Domitian's life<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> are at direct variance
with such an idea. (Cf. ad Juv., vii., 1.) And though we regret
to find that men like Epictetus and Dio of Prusa were included in
the disastrous sentence, it is some relief to learn that Pliny the
younger, though living at the time in the house of the philosopher
Artemidorus, and the intimate friend of Senecio and six or seven
others of the banished, to whom he supplied money (a fact which,
as he himself hints, could not but have been known to the emperor,
as Pliny was prætor at the time), yet escaped unscathed. (Cf. Plin.,
iii., Ep. XI., vii., 19; Gell., xv., 11.)</p>

<p>How far Sulpicia was connected with this movement, or whether
she was involved in the same sentence which overwhelmed the
others, we have now no means of ascertaining. It is quite clear
that all her sympathies were with the Greeks; and the passage
concerning Scipio and Cato (1. 45-50) leaves little doubt that her
philosophical opinions were those of the Stoics. She rivals Juvenal
in her thorough hatred of Domitian; which may, perhaps, be partly
also attributed to family reasons. For we must remember that she
belonged to the gens which produced Servius Sulpicius Galba; and,
as we have noticed on many occasions with regard to Juvenal, an
attachment to that emperor seems to go hand in hand with hatred
of Otho and Domitian. From the conclusion of the Satire, it is
probable that her husband was not implicated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sulpician gens produced many distinguished men; of whom
we may mention the commissioner sent to Greece, and the conquerors
of the Samnites, of Sardinia, and of Pyrrhus, besides the
notorious friend of Marius. Of this illustrious stock she was no
unworthy scion. Martial<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> bears the strongest testimony to the
purity of her morals and the chastity of her life, as well as to her
devoted conjugal affection; which latter virtue she illustrated in a
poem replete with the most lively, delicate, and virtuous sentiments;
and which, had not the licentiousness of the age been beyond such
a cure, might have produced a deep moral effect on the peculiar
vices which especially disgraced the era of the Cæsars. Her husband's
name was Calenus, who not improbably belonged to the
Fufian gens,<a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> and with him she enjoyed fifteen years of the purest
domestic felicity, as we learn from the Epigram addressed to him
by Martial, in which, not without a tinge of envy, he congratulates
Calenus on the possession of so inestimable a treasure. Both Epigrams
are exceedingly beautiful, and every reader of Martial will
be only too ready to say, "O si sic omnia." Of her other works
we unfortunately do not possess a single fragment;<a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> and even the
solitary Satire which bears her name, was at one time, as Scaliger
tells us, falsely attributed to Ausonius.</p>

<p>Very much of the Satire is corrupt. Wernsdorf's seems, on the
whole, the best <em>approximation</em> to a true reading; and the Commentary
of Dousa is, as far as it goes, satisfactory.</p>

of considerable importance in the history of Roman literature. The Paraphrase
of Aratus, which is usually ascribed to Germanicus, is the work of
Domitian. The subject of the poem is poor, but it is executed in a very
respectable manner. Domitian's taste for Roman literature produced its
beneficial effects. He instituted the great pension for rhetoricians, which
Quintilian, for example, enjoyed, and the Capitoline contests, in which the
prize poems were crowned. During this period, Roman literature received
a great impulse, to which Domitian himself must have contributed. From

<h3>SULPICIA.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The Satire opens with an Invocation of Calliope, the Muse of Heroic poetry.
The dignity of the subject, which is in fact the undeserved sufferings of
the good and great men whom Domitian's edict was ejecting from their
homes, deserves a higher strain than is compatible with the more commonplace,
and therefore less powerful, invectives of Iambic metre. The
effect produced by such a measure is described as nothing less than forcing
the civilized world to retrograde to a state of primæval barbarism. The
cause which has led to such a perversion of taste and degradation of intellect
is then examined; which are shown to be the result of a long-protracted
peace. The old Roman valor which had raised the city to the
proud position promised by the father of gods and men, had become gradually
enervated and enfeebled, as it ceased to have an object on which to
exercise itself. The stern and rigid virtue of the best period of the city's
history, which had led her greatest men, even in the fierce struggles for
existence against the rival republic, to appreciate and patronize the philosophy
of Greece, the love of country and the ties of brotherhood which
had been fostered by that "rugged nurse Adversity," were now all buried
in the corpse-like lethargy induced by the enervating influence of a lengthened
peace. The Satire concludes with a bitter denunciation of coming
vengeance against the tyrant; and a prophetic anticipation of the lasting
fame to be enjoyed by the poem.</p></div>

and bid us, in silence, nay, bereft of reason, too, just as when

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>For, what must we suppose? There are two ways by
which Rome reared aloft her mighty head. Valor in war,
and wisdom in peace. But valor, practiced<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> at home and by
civil warfare, passed over to the seas of Sicily and the citadels
of Carthage, and swept away also all other empires and the
whole world.</p>

<p>Then, as the victor, who, left alone in the Grecian stadium,
droops, and though with valor undaunted, feels his heart sink
within him&mdash;just so the Roman race, when it had ceased from
its struggles, and had bridled peace in lasting trammels; then,
revising at home the laws and discoveries of the Greeks,<a name="FNanchor_1569_1569" id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a>
ruled with policy and gentle influence<a name="FNanchor_1570_1570" id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> all that had been won
by sea and land as the prizes of war.</p>

<p>By this Rome stood&mdash;nor could she indeed have maintained
her ground without these. Else with vain words<a name="FNanchor_1571_1571" id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> and lying

queen, "I have given them empire<a name="FNanchor_1573_1573" id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> without limit!"</p>

<p>Therefore, now, he who sways the Roman state<a name="FNanchor_1574_1574" id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a> has commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>all studies, and the philosophic name and race of
men to depart out of doors and quit the city.</p>

<p>What are we to do? We left the Greeks and the cities of
men,<a name="FNanchor_1575_1575" id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a> that the Roman youth might be better instructed in these.</p>

<p>Now, just as the Gauls,<a name="FNanchor_1576_1576" id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> abandoning their swords and scales,
fled when Capitoline Camillus thrust them forth; so our aged

burden, themselves eradicating their own books. Therefore
the hero of Numantia and of Libya, Scipio, erred in that point,
who grew wise under the training of his Rhodian<a name="FNanchor_1578_1578" id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> master;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>among whom the divine apophthegm<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> of Priscus<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> Cato<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> held
it of such deep import to determine whether the Roman stock
would better be upheld<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> by prosperity or adversity. By adversity,
doubtless; for when the love of country urges them
to defend<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> themselves by arms, and their wife held prisoner
together with their household gods, they combine<a name="FNanchor_1585_1585" id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> just like
wasps (a bristling band, with weapons all unsheathed along
their yellow bodies), when their home and citadel is assailed.
But when care-dispelling peace has returned, forgetful of labor,
commons and fathers together lie buried in lethargic
sleep. A long-protracted and destructive peace<a name="FNanchor_1586_1586" id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> has therefore

<p>Thus our tale comes to a close. Henceforth, kind Muse,
without whom life is no pleasure to me, I pray thee warn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>them that, like the Lydian of yore, when Smyrna fell,<a name="FNanchor_1588_1588" id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a> so now
also they may be ready to emigrate; or else, in line, whatever
thou wishest. This only I beseech thee, goddess! Present
not in a pleasing light to Calenus<a name="FNanchor_1589_1589" id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> the walls of Rome and the
Sabines.</p>

<p>Thus much I spake. Then the goddess deigns to reply in
few words, and begins:</p>

<p>"Lay aside thy just fears, my votary. See, the extremity
of hate is menacing him, and by our mouth shall he perish!
For we haunt the laurel groves of Numa,<a name="FNanchor_1590_1590" id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a> and the self-same

consists of five feet; the first a Spondee or Iamb., the second a Dactyl,
and the three last Trochees. Many of Catullus's pieces are in this metre.

its probable etymology from ἰάπτω, jacio; and hence the epithet <em>criminosi</em>
applied to these verses by Horace (i., Od. xvi., 2), and <em>truces</em> by Catullus
(xxxvi., 5). Archilochus, the Parian, who flourished in the eighth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Cic., Tusc. Q., i., 1; Bähr, ad Herod., i., 12), is said to
have been the inventor of the metre, and to have employed it against
Lycambes, who had promised him his daughter Neobule, but afterward
retracted. Cf. Hor., A. P., 79, "Archilochum proprio rabies armavit
Iambo." i., Ep. xix., 23, "Parios ego primus Iambos Ostendi Latio
numeros animosque secutus Archilochi non res et agentia verba Lycamben."
The allusion in the next line is to Hipponax, who flourished cir.
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 540; Ol. lx. He was a native of Ephesus; but being expelled from
his native country by the tyrant Athenagoras, he settled at Clazomenæ,
now the Isle of St. John. The common story is, that he was so hideously
ugly, that the sculptors Bupalus and Athenis caricatured him. And to
avenge this insult, Hipponax altered the Iambic of Archilochus into a
more bitter form by making the last foot a spondee, which gave the verse
a kind of halting rhythm, and was hence called Scazontic, from σκάζω·
or Choliambic, from χῶλος, "lame." Diomed., iii., 503. [A specimen
may be seen in Martial's bitter epigram against Cato. i., Ep. I, "Cur
in Theatrum Cato severe venisti?"] In this metre he so bitterly satirized
them that they hanged themselves, as Lycambes had done, in consequence
of the ridicule of Archilochus. Hence Horace, vi., Epod. 13,
"Qualis Lycambæ spretus infido gener Aut acer hostis Bupalo." Pliny
(H. N., xxxvi., 5) treats the whole story as mythical. Cf. Mart., i., Ep.
97, for some good specimens, and Catull., xxxix. Another form of Choliambic
verse is the substitution of an Antibacchius for the final Iamb.:
e. g., "Remitte pallium mihi quod involasti." Catull., xxv. Two of
Hipponax's verses may be seen, Strabo, lib. xiv., c. 1.</p></div>

powers by Martial, it is probable that Sulpicia had composed many
poems before the present Satire. From the metre Martial chooses for
his complimentary effusion, and from the testimony of the old Scholiast,
it is probable these verses were in Hendecasyllabics; or at all events in
some lyrical metre. There was a poetess named Cornificia in the time of
Augustus, who wrote some good Epigrams. She was the sister of Cornificius,
the reputed enemy of Virgil (vid. Clinton, F. H., in ann. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 41),
but as she was not a <em>lyrical</em> poetess, Sulpicia claims the palm to herself.</p></div>

had served only to train the Romans in that military discipline by which

his glory, in the Grecian games; and having no more enemies against
whom she could turn her arms, had sheathed her sword and applied
herself to the arts of Peace. This seems the most probable interpretation.
Dusa proposes to read Cætera <em>quæ</em>, for Cætera<em>que</em>, and to place
the line as a parenthesis after <em>socialibus armis</em>: but with the sense given
in the text, the substitution is unnecessary. He supposes also Victor to
apply to a <em>horse</em> that has grown old in the contests of the circus; the allusion
would surely be more simple to a conqueror in the Pentathlon.

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>If but little is known of the personal character and life of the
other Satirists of Rome, it is unfortunately still more the case with
Lucilius. Although the research and industry of modern scholars
have collected nearly a hundred passages from ancient writers where
his name is mentioned, the information that can be gleaned from
them with respect to the events of his life is very scanty indeed; and
even of these meagre statements, there is scarcely one that has not
been called in question by one or more critics of later days. It will
be therefore, perhaps, the most satisfactory course to present in a
continuous form the few facts we can gather respecting his personal
history; and to mention afterward the doubts that have been thrown
on these statements, and the attempts of recent editors to reconcile
them with the accredited facts of history.</p>

<p>Caius Lucilius, then, was born, according to the testimony of
S. Hieronymus (in Euseb., Chron.), <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 148, in the first year of the
158th Olympiad, and the 606th of the founding of the city (Varronian
Computation), in the consulship of Spurius Posthumius Albinus
and Lucius Calpurnius Piso. There was a plebeian Lucilian gens,
as well as a patrician, but it was to the latter that the family of the
poet undoubtedly belonged. Horace says of himself (ii. Sat, i., 74),
"Quidquid sum ego, quamvis infrà Lucili censum ingeniumque tamen
me cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque Invidia." Porphyrion,
in his commentary on the passage, says Lucilius was the
great uncle of Pompey the Great; Pompey's grandmother being
the poet's sister. But Acron says he was Pompey's grandfather.
Velleius Paterculus (ii., 29), on the other hand, says that Lucilia, the
mother of Pompey, was daughter of the brother of Lucilius and of
senatorian family.</p>

<p>His birthplace was Suessa, now Sessa, capital of the Aurunci, i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>n
Campania; hence Juvenal (Sat. i., 19) says, "Cur tamen hoc potius
libeat decurrere campo, per quem magnus equos Auruncæ flexit
alumnus, Si vacat et placidi rationem admittitis edam;" and Ausonius
(Ep. xv.), "Rudes Camænas qui Suessæ prævenis." At the
age of fifteen, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 134, he accompanied his patron, L. Scipio Africanus
Æmilianus, to the Numantine war, where he is said to have
served as eques. Vell. Pat., ii., 9, 4. Here he met with Marius,
now about in his twenty-third year, and the young Jugurtha; who
were also serving under Africanus, and learning, as Velleius says,
"that art of war, which they were afterward to employ against
each other." In the following year Numantia was taken and razed
to the ground, and Lucilius returned with his patron to Rome,
shortly after the sedition and death of Tiberius Gracchus; and
lived on terms of the most familiar friendship with him and C. Lælius,
until the death of Scipio, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 129; and even at that early age
had already acquired the reputation of a distinguished Satirist.
According to Pighius (in Tabulis), he held the office of quæstor,
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 127, two years after Scipio's death, and the prætorship, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
117. Van Heusde is also of opinion that he acted as publicanus;
and from a passage in Cicero (de Orat., ii., 70), some suppose he
kept large flocks of sheep on the Ager publicus. Besides Africanus
and Lælius (with whose father-in-law Crassus, however, he was
not on very good terms, vid. Cic., de Or., i., 16) he is said to have
enjoyed the friendship of the following distinguished men, Sp. Albinus,
L. Ælius Stilo, Q. Vectius, Archelaus, P. Philocomus, Lælius
Decimus, and Q. Granius Præco. He had a violent quarrel with
C. Cælius, for acquitting a man who had libeled him. He is said
to have lived under Velia, where the temple of Victory afterward
stood, in a house built at the public expense for the son of king
Antiochus when hostage at Rome. (Asc. Pedian. in Ciceron., Orat.
c. L. Pisonem, p. 13.) He made a voyage to Sicily, but for what
cause, or at what period of his life, is not stated. His closing years
were spent at Naples, whither he retired to avoid, as some think, the
effects of the hatred of those whom his Satire had offended; and
here he died, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 103, in his forty-sixth year, and was honored,
according to Eusebius, with a public funeral. He had a faithful
slave named Metrophanes, whose honesty and fidelity he rewarded
by writing an epitaph for his tomb, quoted by Martial as an instance
of antique and rugged style of writing, xi. Ep., 90.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Carmina nulla probas molli quæ limite currunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sed quæ per salebras altaque saxa cadunt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et tibi Mæonio res carmine major habetur<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Luceili Columella heic situ' Metrophanes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The name of his mistress is said to have been Collyra, to whom the
sixteenth book of his Satires was inscribed. He wrote thirty books
of Satires, of which the first twenty and the last are in Heroic
metre. The other nine in Iambics or Trochaics. He is not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
confounded with a comic poet of the same name, mentioned by the
Scholiast on Horace and by Fulgentius.</p>

<p>Such is the traditional, and for a long time currently-believed,
story of Lucilius' life. The greater accuracy, or greater skepticism,
of modern scholars has called into question nearly every one of
these meagre facts. Even the method of spelling his name has
been a subject of fierce controversy. In the best manuscripts,
especially those of Horace, Cicero, and Nonius Marcellus, the name
of Lucilius is invariably spelt with one l. Yet in spite of this
testimony, in order to square with some preconceived notions of
orthography, the l was doubled by Hadrian Turnebe, Claude de
Saumaise, Joseph Scaliger, Lambinus, Jos. Mercer, and Cortius.
The propriety, however, of omitting the second l has been fully
established by an appeal to MSS. and inscriptions; and to Varges
and Ellendt the credit is due of successfully restoring the correct
mode of spelling. (Cf. Rhenish Philolog. Museum for 1835, and
Ellendt on Cicero, de Orat, iii., 43.)</p>

<p>Again, his prænomen is by some stated to be Lucius; whereas, not
to mention others, Cicero and Quintilian always speak of him as Caius.</p>

<p>But far more serious doubts, and with great probability, have
been cast upon the dates assigned by S. Hieronymus for his birth
and death. Bayle, in his Dictionary, was the first to suggest them;
and they were taken up and urged with great zeal and learning by
Van Heusde (in his Studia Critica in C. Lucilium Poetam, 1842),
who accused Jerome of negligence and incorrectness in the dates he
assigns to many other events: e. g., the overthrow of Numantia,
the deaths of Plautus, Horace, Catullus, Lucretius, and Livius the
tragedian, and the birth of Messala Corvinus. The charge against
the chronographer has been repeated, and with some show of truth,
by Ritschel in the Rhenish Museum, 1843. Van Heusde's line of
argument is simply this, that the dates of Hieron. are inconsistent
with what Horace and Velleius say of Lucilius, and with what the
poet says of himself&mdash;that it is absurd to suppose that a lad of
fifteen could have served as an eques; or that so young a person
would have been admitted to such intimate familiarity with men
like Scipio Africanus and Lælius; and that at the time of Scipio's
death, when, as it is said, Lucilius had already gained a great reputation
as a Satirist, he could have been barely over nineteen years
old; that if he had died at the age of forty-six, Horace would not
have applied to him the epithet "Senex"&mdash;that the year of his
birth must be therefore carried back at least six years, and his death
assigned to a much later period, as he mentions the Leges Liciniæ
and Calpurnia, passed some years after the time fixed by Hieron.
for his death at Naples. In this view Milman coincides: "Notwithstanding
the distinctness of this statement of S. Hieronymus, and
the ingenuity with which many writers have attempted to explain
it, it appears to me utterly irreconcilable with facts." (Personæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Horatianæ, p. 178.) Clinton also says<a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> (F. H., ann. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 103), "The
expression of Horace, Sat., II., i., 34, by whom Lucilius is called
'Senex,' implies that he lived to a later period."</p>

<p>Such are the principal objections to the common accounts. Of
those who hold their accuracy, and endeavor to explain away the
difficulties attaching to them, the chief are Varges and Gerlach. The
principal points will be taken in the order in which they occur.</p>

<p>With regard to the first, Varges shows, in opposition to Bayle, that
it was the custom for young Romans to serve long before the legal
age, either voluntarily, that they might apply themselves sooner to
civil matters, by getting over their period of military service; or
compulsorily, to supply the waste of soldiers caused by the incessant
wars in which Rome was engaged. Hence the necessity for the law
of C. Gracchus to prevent enlistment under the age of seventeen
(νεώτερον ἐτῶν ἑπτακαίδεκα μὴ καταλέγεσθαι στρατιώτην). Cf. Liv.,
xxv., 5. Duk. ad Liv., xxvi., 25. As the equestrian service was
the more honorable, it was probably conceded to Lucilius on account
of his gentle birth and early promise. Gerlach thinks that
Tibullus<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> was only thirteen when he accompanied M. Valerius Messala
Corvinus in his Aquitanian campaign. Now Tibullus was only
of <em>equestrian</em> family. There is no difficulty, therefore, in supposing
that Lucilius, who was of <em>senatorian</em> family, might have served as
eques at the age of fifteen.<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a></p>

<p>As to the fact of Scipio and Lælius admitting him to their intimate
friendship at so early an age, a parallel may be found in the case
of Archias the poet. Besides, Scipio and Lælius were the most likely
men to discover and to foster the early talent of the young poet.
For the <em>fact</em> of the intimacy we have the testimony of Horace, Sat.,
II., i., 71,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quin ubi se a vulgo et scena in secreta remorant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtus Scipiadæ et mitis sapientia Lælî<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nugari cum illo et discincti ludere, donec<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decoqueretur olus, soliti."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>On which the commentator says, "That the three were on such intimate
terms, that on one occasion Lælius was running round the
sofas in the Triclinium, while Lucilius was chasing him with a
twisted towel to hit him with." This story agrees exactly with the
description given by Cicero<a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a> (de Orat., ii., 6) of the conduct of Scipio
and Lælius, who speaks of their retiring together to the country-house
of the former, and to have descended, for the relaxation of
their minds, to the most childish amusements, such as gathering
shells on the shore of Caieta. Who would be more likely than
such men as these to be captivated by the precocious wit and pungent
sarcasm of a sprightly lad?</p>

<p>Again, the character of Lucilius's compositions admits of eminence
at an earlier period of life than the other branches of poetry. And
yet Catullus and Propertius, not to mention many others, attained
great eminence as poets at a very early age; certainly long before
their twentieth year.</p>

<p>The Satiric poetry of Lucilius depending more on a keen perception
of the ludicrous, and shrewd observation of passing events
and the foibles of individuals, would more readily win approbation
at an early age, than compositions whose excellence would consist
in the display of judgment, knowledge of the world, and elaborate
finish. There is, therefore, no reason to suppose that his talent may
not, like that of Cicero, have been developed at an early age, and
having come under the notice, might have won the approbation, of
men of such character in private life as Scipio and Lælius are reported
to have been.</p>

<p>But Horace calls him "senex," ii. Sat., 28, <em>seq.</em></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ille (Lucilius) velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Credebat libris: neque si male cesserat, unquam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decurrens alio, neque si bene, quo fit ut omnis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Votivâ pateat veluti descripta tabellâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vita Senis&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this it is answered: nothing can be more loose and vague than
the employment by Roman writers of terms relating to the different
periods of human life: e. g., "puer, adolescentulus, adolescens,
juvenis, senex." We have seen that Tibullus at the age of forty
may be called "juvenis." Hannibal, at the age of forty-four (i. e.,
two years younger than Lucilius at his death), calls himself senex.
(Cf. Liv., xxx., 30, compared with c. 28, and Crevier's note.)<a name="FNanchor_1598_1598" id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>Persius (Sat. i., 124) calls Aristophanes "prægrandis senex," though,
as Ranke shows in his Life (p. xc.), he was not of great age. We
might add that Horace himself uses the phrase, "poetarum <em>seniorum</em>
turba" (i. Sat., x., 67), as equivalent to priorum.</p>

<p>In the fourth Fragment of the twentieth book, Lucilius mentions
the Calpurnian Law.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Calpurnî sævam legem Pisoni' reprendi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eduxique animam in primoribu' naribus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Van Heusde holds to be the Lex Calpurnia, de ambitu, passed
by C. Calpurnius Piso, when consul, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 687, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 67, at which
time Lucilius would have been eighty-one years old. But there
was another Lex Calpurnia, de pecuniis repetundis, passed by L.
Calpurnius Piso, tribune, in <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 604, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 150. Van Heusde
says the former <em>must</em> be meant, because Lucilius applies to it the
epithet <em>sæva</em>, and Cicero (pro Muræna, c. 46) also styles it "severissime
scriptam." He explains the second line of the Fragment to
mean, that Lucilius "all but paid the penalty of death for his animadversions
of the law," but these words more correctly imply the
"fierce snorting of an angry man." So Pers., Sat., v., 91, "Ira
cadat naso." Varro, R. R., ii., 3, 5, "Spiritum <em>naribus ducere</em>."
Mart., vi. Ep., 64, "Rabido nec perditus ore fumantem nasum vivi
tentaveris ursi." And any law whatever would be naturally termed
"sæva" by him who came under the influence of it.</p>

<p>In the 132d of the Fragmenta Incerta, we have (quoted from
A. Gell., Noct. Att., ii., 24) these words, "Legem vitemus Licini."
The object of this law was to give greater sanction to the provisions
of the Lex Fannia, a sumptuary law, which had become nearly
obsolete. If passed by P. Licinius Crassus Dives Lusitanicus, when
<em>consul</em>, it must be referred to the year <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 657, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 97, six
years after the supposed date of Lucilius's death. But there is no
reason why this law should not have been passed by Licinius when
<em>tribune</em> or <em>prætor</em>, as well as when <em>consul</em>; probably during his
prætorship, as nearer the consulship, though Pighius (Annal., iii.,
122), though without giving any authority, assigns it to his tribuneship.</p>

<p>The Orchian Law was passed by C. Orchius when <em>tribune</em>. The
Fannian and many other sumptuary laws were passed by <em>prætors</em>
or <em>tribunes</em>. The argument therefore derived from the law having
been passed by Licinius, when <em>consul</em>, falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Allowing, however, that Lucilius was alive during the consulship
of Licinius, we have the incidental, and therefore more valuable,
testimony of Cicero, that he must have died very shortly after. In
his "De Oratore," he introduces the speakers in the Dialogue quoting
Lucilius, as one evidently not very recently dead. Now this
imaginary Dialogue is supposed to have taken place <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 91.</p>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>To the first book there is said to have been annexed an Epistle to L. Ælius
Stilo, the friend of the poet, to whom in all probability this book was
dedicated. (Fr. 16.) We know from a note of Servius on the tenth book
of the Æneid (l. 104), that the subject was a council of gods held to deliberate
on the fortune of the Roman state; the result of the conference
being that nothing but the death of certain obnoxious individuals could
possibly rescue the city from plunging headlong to ruin. It is a kind of
parody on the council of Celestials held in the first book of the Odyssey,
to discuss the propriety of the return of Ulysses to Greece: and as Homer
represents Neptune, the great enemy of Ulysses, to have been absent from
the meeting, so here (Fr. 2) we find an allusion to some previous council,
at which Jupiter, by the machinations of Juno (Fr. 15), was not present.
Virgil, as Servius says, borrowed the idea of his discussion between Venus,
Juno, and Jupiter from this book; only he translated the language
of Lucilius into a type more suited to the dignity of Heroic verse. Lucilius's
council begin with discussing the affairs of mankind at large, and
then proceed to consider the best method of prolonging the Roman state
(Fr. 5), which has no greater enemies than its own corrupt and licentious
morals, and the wide-spreading evils of avarice and luxury. But amid
the growing vices which undermined the state must especially be reckoned
the study of a spurious kind of philosophy, of rhetoric, and logic,
which not only was the cause of universal indolence and neglect of all serious
duties, but also led men to lay snares to entrap their neighbors.
(Fr. inc. 2.) A fair instance of these sophistical absurdities is given (Fr.
inc. 12); and the doctrine of the Stoics, to which Horace alludes (i. Sat.,
iii., 124), is also ridiculed. (Fr. inc. 23.) The pernicious effects of gold
are then described, as destructive of all honesty, good faith, and every religious
principle (Fr. inc. 39-47); the result of which is, that the state is
fast sinking into helpless ruin. (Fr. inc. 50.) Nor are the evils of luxury
less baleful. (Fr. 19-21.)</p>

<p>All this discussion, in the previous conference, had been nugatory on account
of the absence of Jupiter, and the divisions that had arisen among
the gods themselves. In this debate Neptune had taken a very considerable
part, since we hear that, discussing some very abstruse and difficult
point, he said it could not be cleared up, even though Orcus were to permit
Carneades himself to revisit earth. (Fr. 8.) Apollo also was probably
one of the speakers, and expressed a particular dislike to his cognomen
of "the Beautiful." (Fr. inc. 145.) Perhaps all the gods but Jove
(Fr. 3) had been present; but as they could not agree, the whole matter
was referred to Jupiter; who, expressing his vexation that he was not
present at the first meeting, blames some and praises others. (Fr. 55, inc.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
<p>The cause of his absence was probably the same as that described (Iliad,
xiv., 307-327) by Homer: which passage Lucilius probably meant to ridicule.
(Fr. 15.) The result of the deliberation is a determination on the
part of the gods that the only way to save the Roman state is by requiring
the expiatory sacrifice of the most flagitious and impious among the
citizens: and the three fixed upon are P. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, L.
Papirius Carbo, and C. Hostilius Tubulus.</p>

<p>(To this book may perhaps also be referred Fr. inc. 2, 46, 61, 63.)</p>

<p>This book must have been published subsequently to the death of Carneades,
which took place the same year as that of Scipio, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 129, twenty-six
years after his embassy to Rome.</p></div>

praying to be freed from the obligation of the Voconian law. (In

with C. Cornelius Cethegus. Being flamen dialis, and therefore not allowed

by a decree of the senate, got the tribunes to obtain a plebis-scitum, that
his brother Lucius, the prætor elect, might be allowed to take the oath

<h3>BOOK II.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>On the subject of this book the commentators differ: some supposing that
it was directed against luxury and effeminacy. But the avarice and licentiousness
of the times form a considerable portion of the writings of Lucilius,
and there are very few of his Satires in which these are not incidentally
glanced at. From the sixth Fragment, which after all is a very
obscure one, Ellendt supposed it was written to expose Æmilius Scaurus.
Corpet maintains that it contained the description of a sanguinary brawl,
in which many persons were engaged; that one person was taken up for
dead, his house purified (Fr. 22), and all preparations made for his funeral,
when some one saw another lying in his bier. Fr. 1. It is quite clear
that Fr. 14, 24, and perhaps 2, refer to luxury; if by Manlius, in the second
Fragment, is intended Cn. Manlius Vulso. (Vid. note.)</p></div>

as contemporary with Cn. Manlius Vulso. Hostilius is Gerlach's reading
for the old <em>hostilibus</em>. Cn. Manlius got the nickname of Vulso from
<em>vellendo</em>, plucking out superfluous hairs to make his body more delicate.
(Plin., xiv., 20. Juv., viii., 114; ix., 14. Pers., iv., 36.) He was
consul <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 189, and marched into Gallo-Græcia, and for his conquests
was allowed a triumph, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 186. Livy enters into great detail in describing
all the various luxuries which he introduced into Rome, such
as sofas, tables, sideboards, rich and costly vestments and hangings, foreign
musicians, etc. Liv., xxxix., 6. Plin., H. N., xxxiv., 3, 8. Cf.
Bekker's Gallus, p. 294. Catax (quasi cadax a cadendo) is explained
by coxo, "one lame of the hip." There is probably an allusion to his
effeminacy. Corpet considers Manlius Verna to be intended, who had
the sobriquet of Pantolabus, i. e., "grasp-all."</p></div>

line. Ellendt (vid. sup.) supposes Æmilius Scaurus to be meant; others,
Æmilius the præco, by whom Scipio, when candidate for the censorship,
was conducted to the forum, for which he was ridiculed by Appius
Claudius. <em>Præcantare</em> is applied to singing magic hymns and incantations
by the bed of one sick, to charm away the disease. Cf.
Tibull., I., v. 12, "Carmine cum magico præcinuisset anus." Macrob.,
Somn. Scip., II., iii. <em>Excantare</em> is "to elicit by incantation." Vid.

as Gerlach says, it may apply equally well to Scipio Nasica, or Opimius,
who killed the Gracchi; perhaps even better to the latter than to Scipio
Africanus, who went <em>voluntarily</em> into exile.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK III.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>We have not only much more ample and satisfactory information respecting
the subject of this Satire from ancient writers, but the Fragments which
have come down to us give sufficient evidence that their statements are
correct. It is the description of a journey which Lucilius took from Rome
to Capua, and thence to the Straits of Messina; with an account of some
of the halting-places on his route, and incidents of travel. Besides this,
which was the main subject, he indulged by the way in a little pleasing
raillery against some of his contemporaries, Ennius, Pacuvius, Cæcilius,
and Terence, according to the old Scholiast. This Satire formed the model
from which Horace copied his Journey to Brundusium, i, Sat., v. The
special points of imitation will be seen in the notes; from which it will
appear that the particular incidents mentioned by Horace, are probably
fictitious. As to the journey itself, Varges and Gerlach are both of opinion
that it was a <em>real</em> one, and undertaken solely for purposes of pleasure;
as it was not unusual for the wealthier Romans of that day to travel into
Campania, or even to Lucania, and as far as the district of the Bruttii.
(Cf. Hor., i., Sat. vi., 102, <em>seq.</em>) These journeys were occasionally performed
on foot: as we hear of Cato traveling on foot through the different
cities of Italy, bearing his own arms, and attended only by a single slave,
who carried his baggage and libation-cup for sacrificing. But Lucilius
probably on this occasion had his hackney (canterius), like Horace, which
carried not only his master's saddle-bags, but himself also. (Cf. Fr. 9.
Hor., i., Sat. vi., 104.)</p>

<p>It is not quite clear whether the scene described at Capua was a gladiatorial
exhibition, or merely a drunken brawl that took place in the streets, from
which one of the parties came very badly off.</p>

the quantity of wells there. It became the great emporium of commerce,
as Delos had been before, and hence was called Delos Minor.
It was a Greek colony, and was called Dicæarcheia, from the strict justice
with which its government was administered, or from the name of
its founder. Plin., III., v., 9. Stat. Sylv., II., ii., 96, 110. Sil. Ital.,

<em>Illud opus.</em> Virg., Æn., vi., 129, "Hoc opus hic labor est," <em>Setia</em>, now
Sezza, near the Pomptine marshes, on the Campanian hills. From its
high position, Martial gives it the epithet "pendula:" xiii., Ep. 112,
"Pendula Pomptinos quæ spectat Setia campos." The country round

the image of Artemis, inclosed for the purpose of concealment in a bundle
of sticks. Hence her name, Phacelitis, or, according to the Latin
form, Facelitis. This image he carried, according to one legend, to
Aricia, near which was the grove of Diana Nemorensis; or, as others
say, to Syracuse, where he built a temple and established her Cultus.

think the upper part of the <em>helmet</em> was so called, which the Samnis wore,

<h3>BOOK IV.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The Scholiast, on the third Satire of Persius, tells us that the subject of that
Satire, which is directed against the luxury and vices of the rich, was
borrowed from the fourth book of Lucilius. In all probability the <em>form</em>
of the Satire is not the same; as the dialogue between the severe censor
and his pupils approaches too near the Greek form, to have suited the
taste of Lucilius. No doubt there is a much closer imitation in the second
Satire of Horace's second book, which also was confessedly composed
upon this model; where the plain and rustic simplicity of Ofella takes
the place of the grave and sententious philosophy of the more dignified
Lælius. The first six Fragments are evidently to be referred to Lælius;
expatiating on the praises of frugality, and exhibiting, by examples, the
hollowness of all the pleasures of luxury and gluttony. We have then
allusions to a combat of gladiators; and several references to women, and
to the impetuous and restless anxieties attendant upon the passion of
love; which are inconsistent with the character of Lælius, and were therefore
put into the mouth of some other speaker.</p>

<p>To the first part of the Satire we may probably refer the Fragments 192,
193, 132, 133, incert.</p></div>

in their gardens with great care. It was called, in its wild state, <em>Rumex</em>.
It was used at banquets, on account of its purgative qualities, together
with the Coan wines, which possessed the same properties. Cf. Hor.,
ii., Sat. iv., 27. Pers., Sat. v., 135. <em>Gumia</em> is a "glutton, epicure,
belly-god." (Lurco, comedo, helluo, gulæ mancipium.) The etymology
is uncertain. Merula reads in all places <em>gluvia</em>, whence <em>ingluvies</em>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1657_1657" id="Footnote_1657_1657"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1657_1657"><span class="label">[1657]</span></a> There are two fish known by the name of <em>squilla</em>; the one apparently
a small fish (perhaps a <em>river</em> fish, as Martial mentions their
abounding in the Liris: lib. xiii., Ep. 83), used as a sauce or garnish for
larger fish. Vid. Hor., ii., Sat. viii., 42, "Affertur <em>squillas</em> inter muræna
natantes," which Orell. explains as a conger served up with crabs. The
other is a large fish forming a dish of itself. Cf. Juv., v., 80, "Quam
<em>longo</em> distendat <em>pectore</em> lancem quæ fertur domino <em>squilla</em>," etc. If it is
represented by the Greek κᾶρις, it is something of the lobster or prawn
kind. It appears to have been dressed sometimes with sorrel sauce.
Cf. Athen., iii., 92, 66. The <em>acipenser</em> is probably <em>not</em> the sturgeon: from
its etymology it is some sharp-headed fish. (Acies et penna, or pinna.)
Salmas., Ex. Plin., 1316: but what it <em>really was</em> is not known. It was
a <em>royal</em> fish, like the sturgeon (Mart., xiii., Ep. 91), and when brought
to table was ushered in with great solemnities: the servant who bore it
had a chaplet round his head, and was preceded by another playing the
flute. Publius Gallonius, the præco, is said to have been the first who
introduced this luxury. Macrob., Sat. ii., 12. In Pliny's time, however,
he tells us, it had gone out of fashion. H. N., ix., 26.
</p>
<p>
<em>Decumanus</em> is used here in the same sense as "Fluctus decumanus,"
i. e., of extraordinary size (Ov., Trist., I., ii., 49), the Pythagorean notion
being that the tenth was always the largest; which notion they extended
even to eggs. (Compare the Greek τρικυμία, Æsch., P. V.,
1015, with Blomfield's gloss.)</p></div>

petulant questionings of an epicure. The missing words are <em>utimur</em> and

ad Juv., xi., 138, 81. Pers., i., 53.
</p>
<p>
<em>Altilis</em> is put for any thing fattened up&mdash;oxen, hares, geese, ducks,
hens, or even fish. Cf. Hor., i., Ep. vii., 35, "Satur altilium." Juv.,
v., 168, "Minor altilis." Athen., ix., c. 32. Woodcocks, snipes,
thrushes, and even dormice, are mentioned among their fatlings.
</p>
<p>
<em>Catillo</em> (either from <em>catullus</em> or <em>catillus</em>, diminutive of catinus, "a dish")
is applied to "a dog that runs about licking the dishes." It is then
used as a term of contempt for "those who came late to the sacrifices of
Hercules, and had nothing left them but the dishes to lick." It is here
used for "the pike that battens on the rich products of the Roman cloacæ."
(Macrob., Sat. ii., 12.) The Roman epicures distinguished between
three different kinds of the Tiber pike (lupus Tiberinus). The
worst were those caught quite out at sea; the second best, those caught
at Ostia at the river's mouth; the finest of all were those taken in the
neighborhood of the embouchures of the sewers, either between the Pons
Senatorius and Pons Sublicius, where the cloaca maxima empties itself,
or between the Pons Sublicius and Fabricius. Hor., ii., Sat. ii, 31,
"<em>Lupus</em> hic <em>Tiberinus</em> an alto captus hiet, <em>pontesne inter</em> jactatus an amnis
Ostia sub Tusci." Juv., v., 104, "Tiberinus, et ipse vernula riparum
pinguis torrente cloacâ."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1660_1660" id="Footnote_1660_1660"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1660_1660"><span class="label">[1660]</span></a> Lucilius probably refers to some rich, strong, full-bodied wine, which
these epicures drank unmixed, contrary to the usual custom. <em>Defusum</em>
seems to be the better reading, which implies "pouring from a larger
vessel, as the crater, into the cyathus or drinking-cup." <em>Diffusum</em> is applied
"to racking the wine from the wine-vat or cask into the amphora,"
when it was sealed down. Cf. Hor., i., Ep. v., 4, Orell. Juv., v., 30.
For the use of <em>snow</em> in cooling wine, see note to Juv., v., 50. This wine
has lost none of its strength by mixing it with snow, and none of its flavor
from having been filtered through the strainer. (Cf. Plin., H. N.,
xiv., 27. Hor., ii., Sat. iv., 51, <em>seq.</em>) A great difficulty with the ancients
seems to have been to clear their wine of the lees; some of the
methods are mentioned in the passage of Horace just quoted. Eggs
were also used for the same purpose. Besides this, the wine was poured
through a <em>colum</em> and <em>saccus vinarius</em>. The former was a kind of metal
sieve, of which numbers have been found at Pompeii. The latter was
a filter-bag of linen. (Hence "integrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem."
Hor., <em>u. s.</em>) The usual plan was to fill both the colum and saccus with
snow, and then to pour the wine over it; and with this view the snow
was carefully preserved till summer, as is still done at Naples. (Hence
"æstivæ nives." Mart., v., Ep. lxiv., 2.) Nero's invention of using
water that had been boiled and afterward frozen, as a substitute for
snow, has been already alluded to. This process also served to moderate
the intoxicating power of the stronger wines; hence the phrases "castrare,
frangere, liquare, vina." (Cf. Plin., H. N., xix., 4,19; xiv., 22;
xxiv., 1, 1. Mart., xii., Ep. lx., 9, "Turbida sollicito transmittere Cæcuba
sacco." xiv., Ep. ciii. and civ.; ix., Ep. xxiii, 8; xci., 5.)</p></div>

<em>edere munus</em>. The first <em>editores</em> were the brothers Marcus and Decimus
Junius Brutus, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 490, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 264, who exhibited a munus gladiatorium
in the Forum Boarium, at their father's funeral. Val. Max., II.,
iv., 7, Liv. Epit., xvi. The country of Samnium afterward produced
many of these gladiators, though probably the name Samnis was also
given to those who were armed after the old Samnite fashion (as Threx,
Gallus, etc. Hor., i., Ep. xviii., 36; ii., Ep. ii., 98. Livy describes
their equipment in detail, ix., 40, which tallies exactly with the paintings
discovered at Pompeii. Vid. Pompeii, vol. i., p. 308, <em>seq.</em>). Æsernia,
now Isernia, was a town in the district of the Pentri in Samnium, to
which the Romans sent a colony in the year above mentioned. Æsernius
was probably some famous gladiator who was a native of this place,
but his name and that of Pacideianus were afterward used proverbially
for any eminent men of that class. Cf. Cic., opt. gen., Or. vi. Tusc.,
iv., 21, ad Quint. Frat., iii., 4. Hor., ii., Sat. vii., 97. Nonius explains
"spurcus" to mean "savage, blood-thirsty."</p></div>

of a certain Velocius, who, when a youth, had applied himself with
great success to the gladiatorial art, so as in fact to be a match for any
one, but afterward never practiced it. The relative claims of the readings
<em>civis</em> and <em>cuivis</em> are discussed at great length in Harles' note to the
passage of Cicero (q. v., ed. Lips., 1816). The <em>rudis</em> was the wooden
sword with which the gladiators practiced; the <em>sica</em> being used in the
<em>ludus</em>. They also received a rudis as a token of their release from service.
Hence "rudem poscere," "rude donatus," etc. Ov., Am., II.,

<h3>BOOK V.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The person to whom this book is addressed, is supposed by Scaliger to have
been a professor of the art of rhetoric. Lucilius complains that this friend,
though he knew he had been ill, had never come to see him; and at the
same time he ridicules the affected and pedantic style of language then in
vogue in the schools of the rhetoricians. He then glances slightly at the
fickleness and inconstancy of his friend's attachment, contrasting the
present state of his feelings with his stanch friendship in former days;
at the same time assuring him that his own heart remains unchanged.
He admits, however, that there is some ground for excuse for this disappointment
of his hopes, as even the good Tiresias of yore was occasionally
found tripping. (Fr. 10.) The causes which lead to breach of friendship
are then discussed, the chief of which is avarice, that lust of gold, that
nothing can satiate; while, meantime the people are lacking the common
necessaries of life. With avarice, ambition springs up; as sure a divider
of faithful hearts as avarice itself. Yet Lælius, that true-hearted and single-minded
man, could hold the highest offices of state without losing his
integrity of heart, or sacrificing the simplicity of his rugged virtues. This
treachery, however, is gradual in its growth. (Fr. 3.) At first a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>bribe alone has power to sever the bonds of friendship; yet soon they give
way before the most paltry inducement. Yet such is the infatuation and
gross folly of men, that they even aim at deceiving the gods themselves
by an affectation of piety. With this depraved state of morals he contrasts
the frugal simplicity of ancient days, describing by the way the
plain and homely elements that composed their forefathers' rustic meal.
There is supposed to be an allusion in this book to one Q. Metellus Caprarius;
a man who proved the worthlessness of his character, both during
his administration as prætor, and afterward when serving in the
camp before Numantia. (Fr. 11, 23, 20, 21, 22, Gerl.) Horace had perhaps
part of this Satire in view, when he wrote his first Satire of the first
book; especially where he mentions avarice as one of the causes which
make men discontented with their lot in life. Very similar sentiments to
those expressed in this book may be found in Sallust also. (Bell. Cat.,
c. xii., init.)</p></div>

we may assert that Lucilius is parodying a line of Pacuvius quoted by
Quintilian (i., c. 5), "Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus."
But the reading of the line is very doubtful. Corpet, after Balth. Venator,
reads, <em>nasi</em> rostrique. D'Achaintre follows the old reading, <em>jussit</em>.
Gerlach reads nisi, but suggests <em>simum</em> (but without quoting Pliny, which
would confirm his conjecture, vid. H. N., IX., viii., 7, "dorsum repandum,
rostrum <em>simum</em>"). Lucil., vii., Fr. 9, "Simat nares delphinus ut

<h3>BOOK VI.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Schoenbeck considers the subject of this book to have been an attack upon
the crafty and dishonest tricks of pleaders in the forum. Gerlach sees in
it little more than Lucilius' favorite theme, the exposure of vile and sordid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>avarice. The miser's anxious alarm for the safety of his money-bags
(Hor., i., Sat. i., 70, "Congestis undique saccis indormis inhians"), which
he can not bear out of his sight, and from which no earthly power can
tear him away (Fr. 1, 2), the miserable appliances of his scanty furniture,
and the absence of any thing approaching to luxury, or even comfort,
form the first portion of the Satire. The remaining Fragments seem
rather to apply to the manners of the nobles. Their insolent disregard
of the feelings of others (Fr. 4), their unbridled licentiousness, their arrogance
of look and bearing, and haughty contempt of all union with plebeians,
are depicted in very bold language. Yet these same men are described
as condescending to the most servile and fulsome flattery in courting
the favor of these same plebeians, when such condescension is necessary
to advance their own ambitious schemes. The extravagant gesture
and overstrained language of some bad orator is then described (Fr. 3),
which Gerlach considers to apply to one of these patricians when pleading
his own cause. Van Heusde refers to no one in particular, but Corpet
supposes there is an allusion to Caius Gracchus, who is mentioned by
Plutarch as having been "the first of the Romans who used violent gesticulation
in speaking, walking up and down the rostrum, and pulling his
toga from his shoulder." What connection the Fragment in which Crassus
and Mucius are mentioned has with the main subject, as also the allusion
in Fr. 5 to some immodest female, is not known.</p></div>

Nonius explains <em>innubere</em> by "transire," because women when married
pass to their husbands' houses: it generally means the same as nubere.
But Cort. (ad Lucan, iii., 23, "Innupsit tepido pellex Cornelia busto")
explains it "marrying <em>beneath one's</em> station," which is very probably its
force here. See Bentley's note on the line, who suggests the emendation

<h3>BOOK VII.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The <em>general</em> subject of the book seems to be agreed upon by all commentators,
though they differ as to the details. Schoenbeck says it is directed
against the lusts of women; particularly the occasions where those lusts
had most opportunity of being exhibited and gratified, the festivals of the
Matronalia and the kindred Saturnalia. Petermann considers that it refers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>simply to the intercourse between husbands and wives, in which view
Dousa seems to coincide. Duentzer takes a wider view, and says it refers
to <em>all</em> licentious pleasures. Van Heusde leaves the matter undecided.
Gerlach coincides with the general view, but supposes that the passions
and the quarrels alluded to must be referred to <em>slaves</em>, or at all events persons
of the lowest station, for whom festivals, like the Sigillaria (alluded
to in Fr. 4), were more particularly intended. The first two Fragments
evidently refer to a matrimonial brawl. The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
refer to an unhallowed passion. The fifth, sixth, and thirteenth to the
unnatural and effeminate refinements practiced by a class of persons too
often referred to in Juvenal and Persius. The fifteenth, to the fastidious
taste of those who professed to be judges of such matters. The connection
of the seventh Fragment is uncertain, as it applies apparently to rewards
for military service.</p></div>

the festival of the Sigillaria. (Auson., Ecl. de Fer. Rom., 32, "Sacra
Sigillorum nomine dicta colunt.") The Saturnalia were originally held
on the 19th of December (xiv. Kal. Jan.), and lasted for one day only.
They were instituted <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 497 (Liv., ii., 21; xxii., 1), and were intended
to commemorate the golden days of Saturn, when slavery was unknown;
hence slaves were waited on by their masters, who wore a short robe,
called the Synthesis, for that purpose. It was a time of general festivity
and rejoicing; and presents were interchanged between friends. The festival
was afterward extended to three days by an edict of Julius Cæsar,
which Augustus confirmed; and, commencing on the 17th, terminated on
the 19th. (Macrob., Sat. i., 10.). Caligula added two more days (or one
at least, Suet., Cal., 17), which custom Claudius revived when it had fallen
into desuetude. Then the Sigillaria were added, so that the period of
festivity was extended to seven days. Mart., xiv., Ep. 72. The Sigillaria
were so called from sigillum, "a small image." (From the words of
Macrobius, it seems that these sigilla were <em>images</em> of men offered to Dis,
and intended as substitutes for the <em>living</em> sacrifices which were offered in
more barbarous ages. Macrob., <em>u. s.</em>) The name was applied to the little
figures which were sent as presents on the occasion of this festival. These
not unfrequently were confectionery or sweetmeats made in this form.
Senec., Ep., xii., 3. Suet., Claud., 5. The Easter cakes in Roman
Catholic countries are no doubt a remnant of this custom. (Cf. Blunt's
Vestiges, p. 119.)</p></div>

<h3>BOOK IX.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The subject of the ninth book is known from several notices in the old
grammarians.<a name="FNanchor_1726_1726" id="FNanchor_1726_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a> It is said to have contained strictures on the orthography
of the ancient writers; some emendations of the verses of Accius and
Ennius (with especial reference to the former, who is said to have always
used double vowels to express a long syllable), and a mention of the
double genius, who, according to the notion of Euclides the Socratic, attends
upon each individual of the human race. The exact connection of
this latter topic with the foregoing, is not at present evident to us. It
appears that this book had anciently the title of "<em>Fornix</em>" as the work
of Pomponius on a cognate subject was called "<em>Marsyas</em>." Van Heusde
supposes that it took its name from the Fabian arch on the Via Sacra, and
that its subject resembled the ninth of Horace's first book of Satires. The
poet, in his walk along the Via Sacra, meets with a troublesome fellow
near the arch of Fabius, who pesters him with a speech which he is about
to deliver, as defendant in a cause, and which he wishes Lucilius to look
over and correct; and that this furnishes the poet with the groundwork
for a discussion on several points in grammar, orthography, and rhetoric.
With this view Gerlach so far agrees, as to suppose the subject of both
Horace's and Lucilius's Satires to have been similar; especially since
many similar phrases and sentiments occur in both; but he considers a
detailed disquisition on single letters and syllables inconsistent with a
desultory conversation, or with a cursory criticism of an oration, and considers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>it better to confess one's ignorance honestly than indulge in vain-glorious
conjecture. Particularly, since many other Fragments of this
book have come down to us, wholly irreconcilable with this view of the
subject; some referring to avarice, others to the Salii; which, though
they might certainly be incidentally mentioned, imply too diversified a
subject to be definitely circumscribed within so limited an outline, as Van
Heusde conjectures.</p></div>

<p>2 First is A. I will begin with this; and the words spelled
with it. In the first place, A is either a long or short
syllable; consequently we will make it one, and, as we say,

Jānum, Aridum, Acetum," just as the Greeks do. Ἄρες

<p>6 "Now come PUEREI." Put E and I at the end, to
make "pueri" the plural; if you put I only, as PupillI,
PuerI, LuceilI, this will become the singular number.
"<em>Hoc illi factum est unI.</em>" Being singular, you will put I
only. "<em>Hoc IllEI fecere.</em>" Add E to mark the plural.
Add also E to MendacEI and FurEI, when you make it
the dative case." MEIle hominum, dub MEIlia." Here
too we must have both vowels, MEIles, MEIlitiam. Pila,
"a ball to play with," Pilum, "a pestle to pound with,"
will have I simply. But to PEIla, "javelins," you must
add E, to give the fuller sound.<a name="FNanchor_1732_1732" id="FNanchor_1732_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a></p>

<p>9 For just as we see Intro (within) to be a very different
word from Intus (inside), so <em>apud se</em> is very different
from, and has not the same force as, <em>ad se</em>. "A man
invites us to come in and join him (intro ad se). He
keeps himself at home, inside his own house (intus apud
se)."</p>

<p>10 "The water boils," may be expressed by <em>Fervit</em> (of the
third conjugation), or <em>Fervet</em> (of the second conjugation).
Or again, <em>Fervit</em> may be the <em>present</em> tense, <em>Fervet</em> the <em>future</em>;
both of the third conjugation.</p>

<p>11 So Fervĕre (with the E short, of the third conjugation).</p>

<p>12 You do not perceive the force of this; or how this differs
from the other. In the first place, this which we call
"Poema" is a small portion. So also an epistle, or any
distich which is of no great length, may be a "Poema."
A "Poësis" is a <em>whole</em> work, as the whole Iliad; it is one
Thesis. So also the Annals of Ennius, that is also a single
work, and of much greater magnitude than what I just
now styled Poëma. Wherefore I assert, that no one who
finds fault with Homer, finds fault with him <em>all through</em>;
nor does he criticise, as I said before, the <em>whole</em> Poesis;
but simply a single verse, word, proposition, or passage.</p>

"tumor inguinis." Gerlach inclines to the latter interpretation. Schmidt
supposes Lucilius to employ the metaphor of weaving to express the following
sentiment: "as the outer surface of the woof is of little consequence
if the inner part be good, so, provided a man's internal qualities,
the virtues of his heart and head, are all that we can desire, it matters
little what the outer integument is that shrouds this fair inside:" and
that to this Horace alludes, ii., Sat. i., 63, "Lucilius ausus Primus in
hunc operis componere carmina morem Detrahere et <em>pellem</em> nitidus quâ
quisque per ora Cederet <em>introrsum turpis</em>." (Lucilii Satyrarum quæ de

<h3>BOOK X.</h3>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The old Scholiast, in his Life of Persius, tells us that "after he had quitted
school, and the instruction of his tutors, he was so much struck with the
tenth book of the Satires of Lucilius, that he was seized with a vehement
desire of writing Satire, and immediately applied himself to the imitation
of this book, and after first detracting from his own merits, proceeded to
disparage the poetical attempts of others." Van Heusde supposes that the
book contained a detailed account of the life of Lucilius; and hence the
saying of the Scholiast, that "the whole life of Lucilius was as distinctly
known as if it had been portrayed in pictures." (So Horace says, Sat.,
II., i., 30, "Quo fit ut omnis Votivâ pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita
senis.") He conjectures the difference between the subjects of the ninth
and tenth books to have been this: that in the ninth, Lucilius criticised
the ignorance and corrected the mistakes of the Librarii; i. e., those who
<em>copied</em> the compositions of the poets, only incidentally, and by the way,
touching on the poets themselves. Whereas the tenth was intended directly
as an attack upon the poets who preceded him. Jahn, in his prolegomena
on Persius, imagines this imitation of the tenth book to have
been carried farther than we are perhaps justified in assuming; he conjectures
that the Hendecasyllabic Prologue of Persius was a direct imitation
of a similar proem, and in the same metre which formed the commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>of this book. This opinion he fortifies by two quotations, one
from Petronius, Sat. iv., the other from Apuleius, de Deo Socr., p. 364. In
this view Gerlach does not coincide, though he is disposed to admit that
Lucilius in all probability began the book with a disparagement of himself,
and so far furnished an example for Persius to imitate. It is a question
that must remain doubtful, and is of no great importance. It is, however,
also clear that this book contained criticisms on the verses of Accius
and Ennius. (Vid. Schol. ad Hor., i., Sat. x.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the Fragments (incert. 3, 4, and 5) on Albutius and Mucius may
have belonged to this book.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XI.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Schoenbeck supposes this book to have been written in memory of the Iberian
war; because it not only touches on military affairs, but contains
also some bitter sarcasms on the morals of certain young men who served
in that campaign. Petermann coincides in the same opinion. Corpet
supposes that the principal object of the book was an elaborate defense of
the character of Scipio Africanus; especially with regard to the salutary
and strict discipline which he restored to the Roman army during the
Numantine war. Gerlach admits the probability of these conjectures,
though he scarcely thinks that the Fragments which have come down to
us of this book are of sufficient length to enable us to pronounce definitively
on the question. It is quite clear that the mention of Opimius the
father, or of the elder Lucius Cotta, can bear no relation to the Numantine
war, since they both lived before it began; still it is possible that
their names might have been introduced, to render the morals of their
sons still more conspicuous. How the Fragment (2) respecting the plebeian
Caius Cassius Cephalo was connected with the main subject is not
clear, unless he was introduced for the purpose of incidentally mentioning
the bribery of the unjust judge, Tullius.</p>

<p>The fourth and ninth Fragments may clearly refer to the Numantine war;
as may perhaps the seventh; as we learn from Cicero, that while Scipio
Africanus was before Numantia, he received some munificent presents,
which were sent to him from Asia by King Attalus, and which he accepted
in the presence of his army. (Cic. pro Dei., 7.) This happened probably
only a few months before the death of Attalus; and Lucilius was most
likely an eye-witness of the fact. The thirteenth Fragment also may refer
to the same campaign; though Duentzer supposes it to be an allusion
to the miserable penuriousness of Ælius Tubero. The fifth and sixth
Fragments apparently refer rather to civil than military matters.</p></div>

iii., 45, "Ille Jugurthino clarus Cimbroque triumpho.") It is here applied
ironically to Lucius Opimius, who so notoriously received bribes
from Jugurtha, when he went over, as chief of the ten commissioners, to
arrange the division of the kingdom between Jugurtha and Adherbal,
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 117. (Sall., Bell. Jug., xvi.) He had been before honorably distinguished
by the taking of Fregellæ, when in rebellion against Rome,
while he was prætor. The safety of the Roman state had also been committed
to him when consul (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 121) during the riots of Caius Gracchus,
which by his prompt measures he was the main instrument in quelling.
(Hence Cicero styles him "civis præstantissimus." Brut., 34.) For
this he was accused by the democratic party, but was acquitted; his defense
being conducted by the same Papirius Carbo who had assailed
Scipio Africanus after the death of Tiberius Gracchus ("aliâ tum mente
Rempublicam capessens." Cic., de Or., ii., 25). The partisans of
Gracchus, however, afterward crushed him by means of the Mamilian
law, along with many other excellent men. Cic., Brut., <em>u. s.</em> Sall.,
Bell. Jug., 40. He was consul with Q. Fabius Maximus, who that year
overthrew the Allobroges and Arverni. His consulship was long remembered
as having been a splendid year for wine, hence called Opimianum.
Cic., Brut., 83. Of his father Quintus, Cicero speaks in nearly
the same terms as Lucilius does here: "Q. Opimius, consularis, qui
adolescentulus malè audisset." De Orat., ii., 68.</p></div>

Why it was given to this Cotta is not known. Gerlach supposes him to
be the L. Cotta mentioned by Cicero (de Orat., iii., 11) as affecting a
coarse and rustic style of speaking, "gaudere videtur gravitate linguæ,
sonoque vocis agresti," and that this name was given him by way of
irony. He would be most justly entitled to the epithet of Crassus, "the
coarse," which was probably given for the same reason. (Crassus not
being the regular cognomen of the Aurelian gens, to which Cotta belonged,
but of the Licinian.) Valerius Maximus gives a story of the
sordid avarice of the father, which illustrates what Lucilius says, that
when tribune of the Plebs he took advantage of the "sacrosanct" character
of his office to refuse paying his creditors their just claims, but was
compelled to do so by his colleagues. (Pighius assigns this event to <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
155.) He was afterward accused by P. Corn. Scipio Africanus minor;
but being defended by Q. Metellus Macedonicus, was acquitted. Cf.
Cic., Brut., 21, where he gives him the epithet "veterator." He was
one of the partisans of the Gracchi.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The extant Fragments of this book are too few and too varied in their matter
to enable us to form any definite idea of the general subject. From a
passage in Diomedes (lib. iii, p. 483), which contains the seventh Fragment,
Schoenbeck supposes it must have referred to scenic matters; which
conjecture he considers farther strengthened by the first Fragment. (Cf.
Plaut., Pers., I., iii, 78.) But, as Gerlach observes, "Chorage" in this
passage can hardly be understood in its primitive sense, since it is coupled
with the word "Quæstore;" and as the quæstors had nothing to do
with the Ludi Scenici, except when it fell to them to take the place of the
prætors or ædiles, this office could hardly be reckoned among their positive
or regular duties.</p></div>

τρύξ, à quo τρύγητος hodieque vindemia est, quia 'Liberalibus,
apud Atticos, die festo Liberi patris vinum cantoribus pro Corollario dabatur'
cujus rei testis est Lucilius in duodecimo." "Others think that
Tragedy is so called from wine, because the ancient term was τρύξ;
whence even at the present day the vintage is called τρυγητός." For the
Attic Dionysia see the second vol. of the Philological Museum. [Probably,
like the Sigillaria in lib. vii., Fr. 4, the festival was described by
some circumlocution, the whole word being inadmissible into a verse.]</p></div></div>

<h3>BOOK XIV.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The fourteenth book contained, according to Schoenbeck's idea, the praises
of a placid and easy life. Duentzer, on the other hand, says the subject
was ambition. The two notions are not so much opposed, says Gerlach,
as at first sight they seem: the object of the poet being to contrast the
frugal simplicity and tranquil leisure of a rustic life, with the empty vanities
and arrogant assumption of the ambitious man. Thus the Fragments
2, 4, 5, 12, 15, 16, and perhaps 1, contain the praises of frugal parsimony
and an honorable leisure: 3, 6, 7, 8, and perhaps others, describe
the heart-burnings and disappointments of a life devoted to ambition.</p></div>

So Nebulo and Tenebrio are used for one who would gladly cloak his
deeds of falsehood and cunning under the mist of darkness. Cic., de
Fin., i., 61, "Malevoli, invidi, difficiles, <em>lucifugi</em>, maledici, monstrosi."
Nebulo is also applied to a vain empty-headed fellow, of no more solidity
than a mist; and then to a spendthrift, who had devoured all his
substance and "left not a wrack behind." Vid. Ælium Stilum ap.
Fest., in voc. Who this desirable person was, is doubtful. Gerlach
thinks that Lucilius' quarrel with him began at the siege of Numantia,
and that this Fragment is part of a speech which the poet puts into the
mouth of Scipio respecting his quæstor. <em>Tuditanus</em> was a cognomen
of the Sempronian gens, from the "mallet-shaped" head of one of the
family. <em>Pavus</em> may have been derived from the taste shown by one of
them for feeding and fattening peacocks. There was a Publius Sempronius
Tuditanus consul with M. Cornelius Cethegus in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 204, and a
Caius Semp. Tuditanus consul <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 129, the year of Scipio Africanus'
death. Cicero speaks highly of his eloquence (Brut., c. 25), and Dionysius
Halicarnassus of his historical powers (i., p. 9).</p></div>

scripta," which resembled our backgammon; the alveolus being a kind
of table on which the dice were thrown, with a rim to prevent their rolling
off. Cicero tells us P. Mutius Scævola was a great adept at this
game. (Or., i., 50.) Gerlach supposes it to be a Fragment of the
speech of some plain countryman, who couples all these things together,
to show that they do not tend to make life happier. <em>Calces</em> will be the
white lines marked on the stadium.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XV.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>None of the commentators on Lucilius have ventured to give a decisive
opinion on the subject of this book, with the exception of Duentzer; who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>says that the poet intended it as a defense of true tranquillity of mind, in
opposition to the precepts and dogmas of the Stoics. In the sixth Fragment
we certainly have mention made of a philosopher; but it is only to
assert that many common and homely articles in daily and constant use
are of more real value than any philosopher of any sect. This, however,
may be supposed to be the opinion of some vulgar and ignorant plebeian,
or of a woman. In the fifth Fragment we have the character of a wife
portrayed, such as Juvenal describes so graphically in his sixth Satire.
Indolent and slatternly in her husband's presence, she reserves all her
graces of manner and elegance of ornament for the presence of strangers.
We have besides a notice of the wonders in Homer's narratives, the praises
of a good horse, a picture of a usurer, an account of a soldier who has
seen service in Spain, a eulogy of frugality and other matters; how all
these can possibly be arranged under one head, is, as Gerlach says, a matter
of the greatest obscurity.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XVI.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>We have in the old grammarians two conflicting accounts of the subject of
this book. Censorinus (de Die Natali, iii.) says that it contained a discussion
on the "double genius" which the Socratic Euclides assigned to
all the human race. On the other hand, Porphyrion (in a note of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>twenty-second ode of Horace's first book) tells us that Horace here imitated
Lucilius, who inscribed his sixteenth book to his mistress Collyra;
hence this book was called Collyra, as the ninth was styled Fornix (in
which also we may observe that it was stated that the double genius of
Euclides was discussed). Priscian again seems to imply (III., i., 8) that
it was inscribed to Fundius; and that Horace copied from it his fourteenth
Epistle of the first book. Gerlach considers the 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th
Fragments may form part of a conversation between Lucilius and his
steward, on the true use of riches. The 10th Fragment may refer to Collyra,
especially if we may suppose that the 13th Fragment (incert.) refers
to the same person. If so, she was probably, like the Fornarina of
Raffaelle, some buxom ἀρτοκόπος (cf. Herod., i., 51) or confectioner. And
this her name seems to imply, Collyra being a kind of circular wheaten
cake, either prepared in a frying-pan, or baked on the coals or in an oven.
(Cf. Coliphium, Juv., ii., 53, and Plaut., Pers., I., iii., 12, "Collyræ facite
ut madeant et coliphia.") She is therefore the "valida pistrix" who understands
the whole mystery of making Mamphulæ, which, as Festus tells
us, was a kind of Syrian bread or cake, made without leaven.</p></div>

commendation: lib. xlii., 29, 51, 67; xliii., 3. Another Cotys assisted
Pompey, for which handsome presents were sent to him: cf. Lucan,
Phars., v., 54. A third Cotys, or Cottus, king of the Bessi, is mentioned
by Cicero as having bribed L. Calpurnius Piso, the proconsul,
with three hundred talents: In Pison., xxxiv. The first of the three is
probably intended here, as Livy tells us that after the termination of the
Macedonian war (in which Scipio served), Bitis, the son of Cotys, was
restored with other captives unransomed to his father, in consequence
of the hereditary friendship existing between the Roman people and his
ancestors. The sayings of Cotys, therefore, might have been current at
Rome in Lucilius' time. Liv., xlv., 42.</p></div>

added. It differs from <em>ornatus</em>, which is applied to rings, bracelets,
earrings, jewels, head-gear, ribbons, etc. (Cf. Liv., xxxiv., 7.)
Hence the usual formula of wills, "Uxori meæ vestem, mundum muliebrem,

<h3>BOOK XVII.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>This book contained, according to Schoenbeck's view, a discussion on the
dogma of the Stoics, "that no one could be said to possess any thing peculiarly
his own." The poet therefore ridicules the creations of the older
poets, who have dignified their heroines with every conceivable embellishment,
and invested them with the attractions of every virtue that adorns
humanity. He then goes through the list of all the greatest mythological
personages that occur in the various Epic poets, in order to show the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>fallacy of their ideas, and establish his own theory on the subject of moral
virtue. Gerlach, on the other hand, considers that the subject was merely
a disparagement of the boasted virtues of the female character; by showing
that even these creations of ideal perfection, elaborated by poets of
the greatest genius, and endowed with every excellence both of mind and
body, are not even by them represented as exempt from those passions
and vices which disgrace their unromantic fellow-mortals. In this general
detraction of female purity, not even the chaste Penelope herself escapes.
The 6th Fragment seems to be directed against those whose verses
are composed under the inspiration of sordid gain.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XIX.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The same may be said of this book as of the eighteenth. The few Fragments
that remain being insufficient to furnish any data for a positive opinion as
to its subject. From the 2d and 3d Fragments, Mercer supposes that the
same question was discussed which Cicero refers to in the Offices (lib. ii.,
c. 20), "Whether a worthy man, without wealth, was to be preferred to a
very rich man who had but an indifferent reputation." The second Fragment
clearly contains a precept respecting the laying up a store which
may be made available in time of distress; which Horace had perhaps in
his eye in book i., Sat. i., l. 33, <em>seq</em>. It contains likewise a criticism on a
verse of Ennius, as being little more than empty sound, devoid of true
poetic sentiment; which probably was the basis of Cicero's censure in the
Tusculan disputations. The study of dramatic composition is also discouraged,
from the fact that the most elaborate passages are frequently
spoiled by the want of skill in the Tragic actor. In the 9th Fragment,
Dacke supposes there is an allusion to the Dulorestes of Pacuvius. The
7th Fragment may also probably refer to Ennius, as the principal word
in it is employed by him in the eleventh book of his Annals. There is
probably also a hit at those poets who adopt a style of diction quite unintelligible
to ordinary readers.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Gerlach without hesitation pronounces the subject of this book to have been
"the superstition of the lower orders, and the luxury of the banquets of
the wealthy." There were, even in the days of Lucilius, many who could
see through, and heartily despise, the ignorant superstition by which
their fellow-men were shackled. Hence the famous saying of Cato, that
he wondered how a soothsayer could look another of the same profession
in the face without laughing. The 3d and 4th Fragments are probably
part of the speech of some notorious epicure, who cordially detests the
simplicity and frugality of ancient days; and the 6th may contain the
fierce expression of his unmeasured indignation at any attempt to suppress
or curtail the lavish munificence and luxurious self-indulgence of
men like himself. The 6th, 7th, and 9th Fragments may also refer to the
sumptuous banquets of the day.</p></div>

frighten children, as bugbears." The forms <em>terriculum</em> and <em>terriculamentum</em>
also occur. Compare the μορμολυκεῖον of the Greeks, Arist.,
Thesm., 417, and μορμὼ, Arist., Achar., 582; Pax, 474 (vid. Ruhnken's
Timæus, in voc., who quotes numerous passages); and Empusa,
Ar., Ran., 293. The <em>Lamiæ</em> were monsters, represented of various shapes
(λάμια, Arist., Vesp., 1177, from λάμος, vorago), as hags, or vampyres
(strigum instar), or with the bodies of women above, terminating in the
lower extremities of an ass. Hence ὀνοσκελίς, ὀνοκώλη. Vid. Hor., A.
P., 340, "Neu pransæ Lamiæ vivum puerum extrahat alvo," cum
Schol. Cruqu. They were supposed to devour children, or at all events
suck their blood. Cf. Tert. adv. Valent., iii. Festus in voc. Manducus,
Maniæ. Manducus is probably from mandendo, and was represented
with huge jaws and teeth, like our "Raw-head and bloody-bones."
It was probably the mask used in the Atellane exodia. Cf. Juv., iii.,
175, "Cum personæ pallentis hiatum in gremio matris formidat rusticus
infans." Plaut., Rud., II., vi., 51, "Quid si aliquo ad ludos me
pro manduco locem? Quapropter? Quia pol clarè crepito dentibus."
The <em>Fauni</em> are put for any persons of great antiquity, the inventors of
these fables (ἀρχαϊκά, Ar., Nub., 812), just as Picus in Juvenal, viii.,
131, "tum licet a <em>Pico</em> numeres genus." Pergula (cf. ad Juv., xi.,
137) is "the stall outside a shop where articles were exhibited for sale,"
and where painters sometimes exposed their pictures to public view.
[Cf. Plin., xxxv., 10, 36, who says Apelles used to conceal himself behind
the pergula, to hear the remarks of passers-by on his paintings.]</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Gerlach considers this book to contain the strongest evidences of how much
Horace was indebted to Lucilius, not only in the choice of his subjects,
but also in his illustration and method of handling the subject when
chosen. In the 105th of the Fragmenta incerta, we find the words "Valeri
sententia dia" (which Horace imitates, i., Sat. ii., 32, "sententia dia
Catonis"). By Valerius he here supposes Q. Valerius Soranus to be intended;
a man of great learning and an intimate friend of Publius Scipio
and Lucilius. He was author of a treatise on grammar, entitled ἐποπτίδων;
which contained, according to Turnebe's conjecture, a discussion on
the mysteries of literature and learning (ἐπόπτης being applied to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>initiated into the mysteries). This is not improbable; as he is said to
have lost his life for divulging the sacred and mysterious name of Rome.
Vid. Plut., Qu. Rom., lxi. [Two verses of his are quoted by Varro, L. L.,
vii., 3, and x., 70. Cf. Plin., H. N., Præf., p. 6, Hard. A. Gell., ii., 10.]</p>

<p>With him, therefore, as a man of judgment and experience, Lucilius, who
had already acquired some ill-will from his Satires, consults, as to the
best method of avoiding all odium for the future, and as to the subjects
he shall select for his compositions. This book then contains an account
of this interview between the poet and his adviser; and Gerlach most ingeniously
arranges the fragments in such an order as to represent in
some manner the topics of discussion in a methodical sequence. These
are, chiefly, the propriety of his continuing to pursue the same style of
writing, and the enunciation of the opinions of both on matters relating
to war, marriage, and literary pursuits.</p>

<p>Van Heusde and Schoenbeck give no definite idea of the subject. Petermann
considers the subject matter to have been far more diversified.
The book begins, in his opinion, with a vivid description of the miseries
of conjugal life, introducing a very graphic matrimonial quarrel; this is
followed by so infinitely diversified a farrago of sentiments that it is hopeless
to attempt to establish any systematic connection between them.</p>

<p>Corpet considers the whole to have been a philosophical discussion of the
miseries of human life, especially those attendant on the married state,
which the poet illustrated by the very forcible example of Agamemnon
and Clytæmnestra.</p>

<p>The whole of the book was composed in the Trochaic metre; consisting of
tetrameters catalectic and acatalectic. A few Fragments consist of Iambic
heptameters and octometers (Iambici septenarii et octonarii), unless,
as is not improbable, these lines have been referred to this book, through
the inadvertence of grammarians or copyists. It might, however, have
been intentional, as in the succeeding books we find Iambic, Trochaic,
and Dactylic metres indiscriminately employed.</p></div>

one. Gerlach takes the contrary view, and says, these very words

even for a very lucrative post in Asia."</p></div>

"to deprive of one's hood," from calautica, "a covering for the head,
used by women, and falling over the shoulders." It seems that Cicero
charged Clodius with wearing one, when he was detected in Cæsar's
house. "Tunc cum vincirentur pedes fasceis, cum calauticam capiti
accommodares." Cic. in Clod. ap. Non., in voc. <em>Decalicasse</em>, is another

women's apartments for the purposes of intrigue, he was obliged to carry
before his face a Lanx perforated with small holes (hence incerniculum),
that he might not be recognized by the women, whose apartments the
law allowed him to search. This process was called, in law, per lancem

<h3>BOOK XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The Fragments of this book are of too diversified a character to form a correct
conclusion with regard to the general subject. Corpet admits the difficulty,
but considers that it contained a criticism upon the philosophic
opinions of the day. Mercer thinks that the principal portion was occupied
by a matrimonial discussion, in which the lady had decidedly the
better of the argument; who being sprung from a more noble descent, and
being possessed of a more ample fortune, considered that the control of the
household pertained to herself, as a matter of right. These conjectures,
however satisfactory as far as they go, will not sufficiently account for the
greater portion of the Fragments. Gerlach supposes that the book contained
a defense of the poet's own pursuits and habits of life against the
attacks of calumniators. The book begins, therefore, with a conversation
between the poet and a friend, when the various points at issue are brought
forward and refuted. The chief of these are the study of poetry; which,
as Lucilius maintains, conduces greatly to the well-being of the state.
He then defends his choice of the particular branch of poetry which he
has adopted, and proves that his satiric view is to be attributed to no arrogance,
self-sufficiency, or malevolence, or envy toward his fellow-men;
that he himself is possessed of a certain evenness of temper, neither elated
by prosperity nor depressed by adversity. The result of this temperament
is an openness of heart, and frankness of disposition, which leads him to
form friendships rapidly, without that cautious circumspection which commonly
attends men of less equable tone of mind. This peculiar disposition
of mind is also one which, extending to itself no indulgence for any
frailty, is but little inclined to overlook the weaknesses of others, but impartially
corrects the failings of itself and others: whereas the more common
character of mankind is to be indulgently blind to those faults to
which they are themselves inclined, and severely critical of the imperfections
of their neighbors. While others, again, make it their whole study
hypocritically to conceal their own defects. He concludes with a sentiment
which Horace has borrowed and enlarged upon, that whereas no perfection
can be expected in this life, he is to be accounted to have arrived
most nearly at the wished-for goal, who is disfigured by the fewest defects;
and since all human affairs are at the best but frail and fleeting, it is a
characteristic of wisdom out of evils to choose the least.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Van Heusde considers that this book contained some severe strictures on the
part of a morose old man, or stern uncle, on the over-indulgence of a fond
and foolish father. Yet a considerable portion of the Satire seems to contain
a defense of the poet himself against the assaults of some invidious
maligners, and in order to do this, he enters, generally, into a discussion
of the habits and manners of young men of the age. Their licentiousness,
he is prepared to admit, has been in great measure produced by the want
of restraint in early youth. This petulance develops itself in an uncontrolled
license of speech, regardless of all annoyance to the feelings of
others&mdash;in avarice&mdash;in haughtiness, the peculiar vice of men of rank&mdash;ambition,
luxury, and love of sensual pleasure. These charges he illustrates
by a passage quoted from Cæcilius. Even those who do show some
taste for better things, and apply themselves to the cultivation of philosophy,
do not, like Polemon, adopt the severe maxims of a self-denying
system, but attach themselves to the school of Epicurus or Aristippus.
To such as these, all good advice, all endeavors to reclaim them to the
rugged paths of a stricter morality, are utterly hopeless and unavailing.</p></div>

Columella in the sense of "plucking up, weeding out," eridicare; and
metaphorically by Cicero in the same sense. (Tusc., iii., 34.) Gerlach
maintains that <em>nervos eligere</em> is not Latin, and reads <em>nervos elidat</em> [which
is confirmed by a passage in the same treatise of Cicero, "Nervos omnes
virtutis elidunt." Tusc., ii., 11].</p></div>

and being suddenly converted by that philosopher's lecture on
temperance, is told by Diogenes Laertius (in Vit., i., c. 1), and referred
to by Horace, ii., Sat. iii., 253, "Faciasne quod olim mutatus Polemon?
ponas insignia morbi Fasciolas, cubital, focalia, potus ut ille dicitur ex
collo furtim carpsisse coronas postquam est impransi correptus voce magistri."
He afterward succeeded Xenocrates; and Zeno and Arcesilaus
were among his hearers. Cic., Orat., iii., 18.</p></div>

are applied is uncertain. The Fabian gens are most probably alluded
to. The reading "verrucosus," therefore, has been suggested, to identify
the person with the great Fabius Cunctator. (Aur. Vict., Vir. Ill., 43.)
But this violates the metre, and still leaves the two other epithets unaccounted
for. Three famous men of the gens had the prænomen Quintus,
Æmilianus, his son Allobrogicus, and his grandson. Gerlach considers
the last to be the object of the Satire, as his profligacy and licentiousness
were notorious. Cf. Val. Max., III., v., 2.</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The remains of this book are so mutilated and so diversified, that, as Gerlach
says, "one might be disposed to imagine that the very essence of the subject
was its unconnected variety." Both he and Merula, however, consider
that it contained a long episode on the state of morality in the good old
days; when the war with Hannibal rendered a luxurious indulgence incompatible
even with personal safety. (Cf. Juv., vi., 291. Sulpic., 51, 52.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>An old man is introduced inveighing bitterly against the sloth, the luxury,
and immoderate extravagance of the young men of his day; of their
unscrupulousness as to the means by which the money was acquired,
which was squandered on their licentious pleasures. He then describes
one of these scenes of dissipation; and shows how young men, once entangled
in the snares of their worthless paramours not only become lost
to every principle of virtue and sense of shame, but are so completely enslaved
and enthralled by their passions, that they are able to refuse nothing,
however unworthy of them, which is exacted by their tyrannical mistresses.
This corruption extends itself, also, not only to the courts of law,
where justice has become a matter of barter, both with advocates and

inc. 193, "Occidunt Lupe te saperdæ et jura siluri," where he satirizes
his luxuriousness; here he alludes to his unjust dealings as judge. Cf.
ad Pers., i., 114. <em>Interdicere aquâ et igni</em>, the technical phrase for banishment.
Cf. Cæs., B. G., vi., 44. Cic., Phil., vi., 4. Fam., xi., 1. Lupus
appears to grieve that the banished man has still two elements, air and
earth, left to enjoy. Thales is said to have been the first to use ἀρχαὶ in
the sense of "first principles." (Vid. Ritter's History of Philosophy.)
Empedocles first reduced the elements to four, and called them ῥιζώματα.
Plato first called them στοιχεῖα, vid. Tim., 48. <em>Adesse</em> is applied both to
the defendant who <em>appears</em> before the tribunal and to the advocate who
<em>stands by</em> to support him. [Cicero seems to allude to the passage in his
speech for Roscius (pro Rosc. Am., xxvi.), "Non videntur hunc hominem
ex rerum naturâ sustulisse et eripuisse, cui repente cœlum, solem, aquam,
terramque ademerint?" Cf. de Orat., i., c. 50, 1.]</p></div>

<h3>BOOK XXX.</h3>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Most of the commentators seem to be agreed that the subject of this book
was "matrimonial life." Mercer considers that it contained an altercation
between a married couple, in which the lady strenuously refuses to submit
to the lawful authority of her husband. Van Heusde says that in it were
depicted the miseries of married life generally; especially of those husbands
who are so devoted to their wives, that they surrender the reins of
government into the hands of those, for whom the law compels them to provide
subsistence, not only at the expense of their own personal labor, but
also at the risk of life itself: the only return which they receive as an
equivalent from the hands of their wives, being opprobrious language, ill
temper, haughty exaction, treachery, and unfaithfulness to the marriage-bed.
In addition to this, Gerlach thinks that in this, his last book, Lucilius
recapitulated the subjects of his previous Satires; and consequently many
Fragments are assigned to this book, which might easily be inserted in
others. Among other matters, the poet also defends himself against the
malignant charges of envious critics, one, Gaius, being especially noticed.
The story of the old lion, which Horace has copied [i., Ep. i., 74], may
also lead us to suppose that the treachery of false friends formed part of
the matter of the poem.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Gerlach considers that the 80th was undoubtedly the <em>last</em> book. The
passages quoted from subsequent books are the result of the carelessness
of the Librarii. These passages, therefore, will all be found incorporated
into the preceding books.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! heavens&mdash;while <span class="smcap">THUS</span> hoarse Codrus perseveres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To force his Theseid on my tortured ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I not <span class="smcap">ONCE</span> attempt "to quit the score,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Always</span> an auditor, and nothing more!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forever at my side, shall this rehearse     <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His elegiac, that his comic verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpunished? shall huge Telephus, at will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The livelong day consume, or, huger still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orestes, closely written, written, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the broad marge, and yet&mdash;no end in view!     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Away, away!&mdash;None knows his home so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I the grove of Mars, and Vulcan's cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the Æolian rocks!&mdash;How the Winds roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How ghosts are tortured on the Stygian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Jason stole the golden fleece, and how     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Centaurs fought on Othrys' shaggy brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walks of Fronto echo round and round&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The columns trembling with the eternal sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While high and low, as the mad fit invades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bellow the same trite nonsense through the shades.     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">I, too, can write</span>&mdash;and, at a pedant's frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Once</span> poured my fustian rhetoric on the town:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And idly proved that Sylla, far from power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had passed, unknown to fear, the tranquil hour:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I resume my pen; for, since we meet     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such swarms of desperate bards in every street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis vicious clemency to spare the oil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hapless paper they are sure to spoil.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But why I choose, adventurous, to retrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Auruncan's route, and, in the arduous race,     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow his burning wheels, attentive hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If leisure serve, and truth be worth your ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the soft eunuch weds, and the bold fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tilts at the Tuscan boar, with bosom bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one that oft, since manhood first appeared,     <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has trimmed the exuberance of this sounding beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wealth outvies the senate; when a vile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slave-born, slave-bred, vagabond of Nile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crispinus, while he gathers now, now flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His purple open, fans his summer rings;     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as his fingers sweat beneath the freight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries, "Save me&mdash;from a gem of greater weight!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis hard a less adventurous course to choose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While folly plagues, and vice inflames the Muse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For who so slow of heart, so dull of brain,     <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So patient of the town, as to contain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bursting spleen, when, full before his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swings the new chair of lawyer Matho by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crammed with himself! then, with no less parade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That caitiff's, who his noble friend betrayed,     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who now, in fancy, prostrate greatness tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And preys on what the imperial vulture spares!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Massa dreads, Latinus, trembling, plies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a fair wife, and anxious Carus buys!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When those supplant thee in thy dearest rights,     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who earn rich legacies by active nights;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those, whom (the shortest, surest way to rise)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The widow's itch advances to the skies!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that an equal rank her minions hold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just to their various powers, she metes her gold,     <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Proculeius mourns his scanty share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Gillo triumphs, hers and nature's heir!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him triumph! 'tis the price of blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, thus defrauded of the generous flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The color flies his cheek, as though he prest,     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unsuspecting foot, a serpent's crest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stood engaged at Lyons to declaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the least peril is the loss of fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ye gods!&mdash;what rage, what phrensy fires my brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that false guardian, with his splendid train,     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowds the long street, and leaves his orphan charge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prostitution, and the world at large!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, by a juggling sentence damned in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For who, that holds the plunder, heeds the pain?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marius to wine devotes his morning hours,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughs, in exile, at the offended Powers:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While, sighing o'er the victory she won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Province finds herself but more undone!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall I feel, that crimes like these require<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The avenging strains of the Venusian lyre,     <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not pursue them? I shall I still repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The legendary tales of Troy and Crete;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toils of Hercules, the horses fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On human flesh by savage Diomed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lowing labyrinth, the builder's flight,     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rash boy, hurl'd from his airy height?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, what the law forbids the wife to heir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The adulterer's Will may to the wittol bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave, with wand'ring eye and vacant face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tacit sanction to his own disgrace;     <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while at every turn a look he stole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snored, unsuspected, o'er the treacherous bowl!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When he presumes to ask a troop's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who spent on horses all his father's land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, proud the experienced driver to display,     <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His glowing wheels smoked o'er the Appian way:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there our young Automedon first tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His powers, there loved the rapid car to guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While great Pelides sought superior bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toyed and wantoned with his master-miss.     <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who would not, reckless of the swarm he meets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill his wide tablets, in the public streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With angry verse? when, through the midday glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne by six slaves, and in an open chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forger comes, who owes this blaze of state     <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a wet seal and a fictitious date;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes, like the soft Mæcenas, lolling by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And impudently braves the public eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the rich dame, who stanched her husband's thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With generous wine, but&mdash;drugged it deeply first!     <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, more dext'rous than Locusta, shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her country friends the beverage to compose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, midst the curses of the indignant throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear, in broad day, the spotted corpse along.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dare nobly, man! if greatness be thy aim,     <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And practice what may chains and exile claim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Guilt's broad base thy towering fortunes raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For virtue starves on&mdash;universal praise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While crimes, in scorn of niggard fate, afford<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ivory couches, and the citron board,     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goblet high-embossed, the antique plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lordly mansion, and the fair estate!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O! who can rest&mdash;who taste the sweets of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sires debauch the son's too greedy wife;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When males to males, abjuring shame, are wed,     <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beardless boys pollute the nuptial bed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No: <span class="smcap">Indignation</span>, kindling as she views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall, in each breast, a generous warmth infuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pour, in Nature and the Nine's despite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such strains as I, or Cluvienus, write!     <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">E'er since Deucalion, while, on every side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bursting clouds upraised the whelming tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached, in his little skiff, the forked hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought, at Themis' shrine, the Immortals' will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When softening stones grew warm with gradual life,     <span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pyrrha brought each male a virgin wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever, passions have the soul possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever wild desires inflamed the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy, Sorrow, Fear, Love, Hatred, Transport, Rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall form the motley subject of my page.     <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when could Satire boast so fair a field?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, when did Vice a richer harvest yield?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When did fell Avarice so engross the mind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when the lust of play so curse mankind?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer, now, the pocket's stores supply     <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boundless charges of the desperate die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chest is staked!&mdash;muttering the steward stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce resigns it, at his lord's commands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it a <span class="smcap">SIMPLE MADNESS</span>,&mdash;I would know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To venture countless thousands on a throw,     <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet want the soul, a single piece to spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clothe the slave, that shivering stands and bare!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who called, of old, so many seats his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on seven sumptuous dishes supped alone?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then plain and open was the cheerful feast,     <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every client was a bidden guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, at the gate, a paltry largess lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eager hands and tongues dispute the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first (lest some false claimant should be found),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wary steward takes his anxious round,     <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pries in every face; then calls aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come forth, ye great Dardanians, from the crowd!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, mixed with us, e'en these besiege the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scramble for&mdash;the pittance of the poor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dispatch the Prætor first," the master cries,     <span class="linenum">165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And next the Tribune." "No, not so;" replies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Freedman, bustling through, "first come is, still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First served; and I may claim my right, and will!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though born a slave ('tis bootless to deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What these bored ears betray to every eye),     <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On my own rents, in splendor, now I live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On five fair freeholds! Can the <span class="smcap">PURPLE</span> give<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their Honors, more? when, to Laurentum sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Noble</span> Corvinus tends a flock for bread!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas and the Licinii, in estate,     <span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must yield to me: let, then, the Tribunes wait."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, let them wait! thine, Riches, be the field!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not meet, that he to Honor yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <span class="smcap">sacred Honor</span>, who, with whitened feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hawked for sale, so lately, through the street.     <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O gold! though Rome beholds no altars flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No temples rise to thy pernicious name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as to Victory, Virtue, Faith are reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Concord, where the clamorous stork is heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet is thy full divinity confest,     <span class="linenum">185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy shrine established here, in every breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But while, with anxious eyes, the great explore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much the dole augments their annual store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What misery must the poor dependent dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom this small pittance clothed, and lodged, and fed?     <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wedged in thick ranks before the donor's gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A phalanx firm, of chairs and litters, waits:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither one husband, at the risk of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurries his teeming, or his bedrid wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another, practiced in the gainful art,     <span class="linenum">195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deeper cunning tops the beggar's part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plants at his side a close and empty chair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My Galla, master;&mdash;give me Galla's share."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Galla!" the porter cries; "let her look out."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sir, she's asleep. Nay, give me;&mdash;can you doubt!"     <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">What rare pursuits employ the clients' day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First to the patron's door their court to pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next to the forum, to support his cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence to Apollo, learned in the laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the triumphal statues; where some Jew,     <span class="linenum">205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some mongrel Arab, some&mdash;I know not who&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has impudently dared a niche to seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit to be p&mdash;&mdash; against, or&mdash;what you please.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning home, he drops them at the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the weary clients, wise too late,     <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resign their hopes, and supperless retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spend the paltry dole in herbs and fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, their patron sees his palace stored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every dainty earth and sea afford:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on th' unsocial couch, he rolls his eyes     <span class="linenum">215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er many an orb of matchless form and size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selects the fairest to receive his plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, at one meal, devours a whole estate!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who (for not a parasite is there)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The selfishness of luxury can bear?     <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
<span class="i0">See! the lone glutton craves whole boars! a beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Designed, by nature, for the social feast!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But speedy wrath o'ertakes him: gorged with food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swollen and fretted by the peacock crude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seeks the bath, his feverish pulse to still,     <span class="linenum">225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence sudden death, and age without a Will!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift flies the tale, by witty spleen increast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And furnishes a laugh at every feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laugh, his friends not undelighted hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fallen from all their hopes, insult his bier.     <span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> is left, <span class="smcap">NOTHING</span>, for future times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To add to the full catalogue of crimes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The baffled sons must feel the same desires,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Spread all thy canvas, Satire, to the gale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But where the powers so vast a theme requires?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the plain times, the simple, when our sires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoyed a freedom, which I dare not name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave the public sin to public shame,     <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heedless who smiled or frowned?&mdash;Now, let a line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But glance at Tigellinus, and you shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chained to a stake, in pitchy robes, and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lugubrious torch, the deepening shades of night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, writhing on a hook, are dragged around,     <span class="linenum">245</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with your mangled members, plow the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What, shall the wretch of hard, unpitying soul,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tower by triumphant, and look down on me!     <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes; let him look. He comes! avoid his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on your lip your cautious finger lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowds of informers linger in his rear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bring, if you please, Æneas on the stage,     <span class="linenum">255</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce war, with the Rutulian prince, to wage;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What time his drugs were speeding to the tomb<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, while the hypocrites their crimes arraign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn, like the trampled asp, and bite again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They must; they do:&mdash;When late, amid the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A zealot of the sect exclaimed aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sleeps the Julian law? Laronia eyed     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scowling Stoicide, and taunting, cried,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such potent fragrance breathes? nor let it shame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our faults, you say, are many; theirs are more:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One proof in us, of this detested kind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure days and nights with Cluvia, Flora led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tedia chastely shared Catulla's bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Hippo's brutal itch both sexes tried,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proved, by turns, the bridegroom and the bride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We ne'er, with misspent zeal, explore the laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We throng no forum, and we plead no cause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some few, perhaps, may wrestle, some be fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To aid their breath, with strong athletic bread.     <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye fling the shuttle with a female grace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cowered o'er your labor, like the squalid jade,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"Why Hister's freedman heired his wealth, and why     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">I spare to tell; the wife that, swayed by gain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Acquit the vultures, and condemn the doves!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paused: the unmanly zealots felt the sway     <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Again Crispinus comes! and yet again,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In native loathsomeness, his loathsom'st deeds,     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, what can satire? For a fish that weighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six pounds, six thousand sesterces he paid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those report, who catch, with greedy ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And magnify the mighty things they hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had this expense been meant, with well-timed skill,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gull some childless dotard of a Will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bribe some rich and fashionable fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who flaunts it in a close, wide-windowed chair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere worth our praise:&mdash;but no such plot was here.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have bought the fisherman himself for less;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bought, in some countries, manors at this rate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in Apulia, an immense estate!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fact I bring no lofty chord requires:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor let the poet style you <span class="smcap">Maids</span>, in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the last Flavius, drunk with fury, tore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prostrate world, which bled at every pore,     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rome beheld, in body as in mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It chanced, that where the fane of Venus stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reared on Ancona's coast by Grecian hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A turbot, wandering from the Illyrian main,     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">For who would dare to sell it? who to buy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the coast swarmed with many a practiced spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mud-rakers, prompt to swear the fish had fled     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Cæsar's ponds, ingrate! where long it fed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whatever rare or precious swims the main,     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The obnoxious dainty, when and where you please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This point allowed, our wary boatman chose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give&mdash;what, else, he had not failed to lose.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now were the dogstar's sickly fervors o'er,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, pinched with cold, her frozen livery wore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old began their quartan fits to fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As if the sultry South corruption blew.&mdash;    <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the lake, and now the hill he gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Alba, though in ruins, still maintains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan fire, which, but for her, were lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worships Vesta, though with less of cost.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wondering crowd, that gathered to survey     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Satiate, at length retires; the gates unfold!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring, the excluded senators behold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(For what were Præfects more?) had snatched his gown,     <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And rushed to council: from the ivory chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dealt out justice with no common care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yielded oft to those licentious times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where he could not punish, winked at crimes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then old, facetious Crispus tript along,     <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gentle manners, and persuasive tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None fitter to advise the lord of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had that pernicious pest, whom thus we call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allowed a friend to soothe his savage mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give him counsel, wise at once and good.     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who shall dare this liberty to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, every word you hazard, life's at stake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though but of stormy summers, showery springs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tyrants' ears, alas! are ticklish things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So did the good old man his tongue restrain;     <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor strove to stem the torrent's force in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one of those, who, by no fears deterred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke the free soul, and truth to life preferred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He temporized&mdash;thus fourscore summers fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in that court, securely, o'er his head.     <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next him, appeared Acilius hurrying on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of equal age&mdash;and followed by his son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fell, unjustly fell, in early years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A victim to the tyrant's jealous fears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But long ere this were hoary hairs become     <span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prodigy, among the great, at Rome;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, had I rather owe my humble birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail brother of the giant-brood, to earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor youth! in vain the ancient sleight you try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, with frantic air, and ardent eye,     <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fling every robe aside, and battle wage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bears and lions, on the Alban stage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All see the trick: and, spite of Brutus' skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are who count him but a driveler still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, in his days, it cost no mighty pains     <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To outwit a prince, with much more beard than brains.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rubrius, though not, like these, of noble race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed with equal terror in his face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, laboring with a crime too foul to name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More, than the pathic satirist, lost to shame.     <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Montanus' belly next, and next appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The legs, on which that monstrous pile was reared.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Crispinus followed, daubed with more perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus early! than two funerals consume.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bloodier Pompey, practiced to betray,     <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hesitate the noblest lives away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Fuscus, who in studious pomp at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planned future triumphs for the Arms of Rome.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Blind to the event! those arms, a different fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inglorious wounds, and Dacian vultures, wait.     <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Last, sly Veiento with Catullus came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deadly Catullus, who, at beauty's name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took fire, although unseen: a wretch, whose crimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck with amaze even those prodigious times.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A base, blind parasite, a murderous lord,     <span class="linenum">165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bridge-end raised to the council-board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fitter still to dog the traveler's heels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whine for alms to the descending wheels!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None dwelt so largely on the turbot's size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or raised with such applause his wondering eyes;     <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the left (O, treacherous want of sight)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He poured his praise;&mdash;the fish was on the right!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus would he at the fencer's matches sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shout with rapture, at some fancied hit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus applaud the stage-machinery, where     <span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youths were rapt aloft, and lost in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor fell Veiento short:&mdash;as if possest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all Bellona's rage, his laboring breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst forth in prophecy; "I see, I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The omens of some glorious victory!     <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some powerful monarch captured!&mdash;lo, he rears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horrent on every side, his pointed spears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arviragus hurled from the British car:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fish is foreign, foreign is the war."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Proceed, great seer, and what remains untold,     <span class="linenum">185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The turbot's age and country, next unfold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall your lord his fortunes better know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the conquest waits and who the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The emperor now the important question put,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How say ye, Fathers, <span class="smcap">SHALL THE FISH BE CUT</span>?"     <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O, far be that disgrace," Montanus cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No, let a pot be formed, of amplest size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within whose slender sides the fish, dread sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May spread his vast circumference entire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring, bring the tempered clay, and let it feel     <span class="linenum">195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quick gyrations of the plastic wheel:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Cæsar, thus forewarned, make no campaign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless your potters follow in your train!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Montanus ended; all approved the plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all, the speech, so worthy of the man!     <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Versed in the old court luxury, he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feasts of Nero, and his midnight crew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where oft, when potent draughts had fired the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jaded taste was spurred to gorge again.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in my time, none understood so well     <span class="linenum">205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The science of good eating: he could tell,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At the first relish, if his oysters fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Rutupian, or the Lucrine bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from a crab, or lobster's color, name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The country, nay, the district, whence it came.     <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here closed the solemn farce. The Fathers rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each, submissive, from the presence hies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, trembling wretches, whom the chief, in sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had dragged, astonished, to the Alban court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the stern Sicambri were in arms,     <span class="linenum">215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the fierce Catti threatened new alarms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if ill news by flying posts had come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathering nations sought the fall of Rome!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O! that such scenes (disgraceful at the most)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had all those years of cruelty engrost,     <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which his rage pursued the great and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked, while vengeance slumbered o'er their blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet he fell!&mdash;for when he changed his game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first grew dreadful to the vulgar name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seized the murderer, drenched with Lamian gore,     <span class="linenum">225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurled him, headlong, to the infernal shore!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And gnaw the crusts, which dogs refuse to eat!&mdash;    <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">For, first, of this be sure: whene'er your lord<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What time the fading stars announced the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at that earlier hour, when, with slow roll,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then hurl the jugs around, with mutual rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, stung to madness by the household train,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One cordial drop, to cheer a fainting friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, he will change, and, haply, fill     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">For Virro, like his brother peers, of late,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whom Dido prized, above the Libyan lord.<span class="bracket">}</span>     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Beneventine cobbler's four-lugged pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fragment, a mere shard, of little worth,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">If Virro's veins with indigestion glow,     <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">Getulian slaves your vile potations pour,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Black mouldy fragments, which defy the saw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet, should you dare&mdash;a slave springs forth, to wrest<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, I believe that <span class="smcap">Chastity</span> was known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prized on earth, while Saturn filled the throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rocks a bleak and scanty shelter gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sheep and shepherds thronged one common cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the mountain wife her couch bestrewed     <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With skins of beasts, joint tenants of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reeds, and leaves plucked from the neighboring tree:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman, Cynthia, far unlike to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thee, weak child of fondness and of fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose eyes a sparrow's death suffused with tears:     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strong, and reaching to her burly brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her big-swollen breasts, replete with wholesome food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rougher than her husband, gorged with mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frequent belching from the coarse repast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when the world was new, the race that broke,     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfathered, from the soil or opening oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived most unlike the men of later times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The puling brood of follies and of crimes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Haply some trace of Chastity remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Jove, but Jove as yet unbearded, reigned:     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the Greek bound, by another's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His doubtful faith; or men, of theft in dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had learned their herbs and fruitage to immure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all was uninclosed, and all secure!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length Astrea, from these confines driven,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regained by slow degrees her native heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her retired her sister in disgust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the world to rapine, and to lust.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis not a practice, friend, of recent date,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But old, established, and inveterate,     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">What more than madness has thy soul possest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What snakes, what Furies, agitate thy breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavens! wilt thou tamely drag the galling chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While hemp is to be bought, while knives remain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While windows woo thee so divinely high,     <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tiber and the Æmilian bridge are nigh?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"O, but the law," thou criest, "the Julian law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will keep my destined wife from every flaw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, I die for heirs." Good! and for those,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou the turtle and the turbot lose,     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the dainties, which the flatterer, still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaps on the childless, to secure his Will?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But what will hence impossible be held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou, old friend, to wedlock art impelled?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou, the veriest debauchee in town,     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom wives, widows, every thing went down,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And bleed him copiously, good doctor, bleed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jewel of men! thy knees to Jove incline,     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let a heifer fall at Juno's shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy researches for a wife be blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one, who is not&mdash;need I speak the rest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! few the matrons Ceres now can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hallowed fillets, with chaste hands, to bind;     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few whom their fathers with their lips can trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strong their filial kisses smack of lust!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Go then, prepare to bring your mistress home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crown your doors with garlands, ere she come.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But will one man suffice, methinks, you cry,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all her wants and wishes? Will one eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet there runs, 'tis said, a wondrous tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some pure maid, who lives&mdash;in some lone vale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There she <span class="smcap">MAY</span> live; but let the phœnix, placed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Break the thick ice, and, ere the sun appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunge in the crashing eddy to the ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, shivering from the keen and eager breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crawl round the banks, on bare and bleeding knees.     <span class="linenum">755</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>

<span class="i0">With his Anubis, his dog-headed god!     <span class="linenum">765</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt by a linen-clad, a bald-pate crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of howling vagrants, who their cries renew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And great the atonement due;&mdash;the silver snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abhorrent of the deed, was seen to quake!     <span class="linenum">775</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he prevails:&mdash;Osiris hears his prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, softened by a goose, the culprit spares.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without her badge, a Jewess now draws near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, trembling, begs a trifle in her ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No common personage! she knows full well     <span class="linenum">780</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">For Jews are moderate, and, for farthing fees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will sell what fortune, or what dreams you please.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prophetess dismissed, a Syrian sage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now enters, and explores the future page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a dove's entrails: there he sees express'd     <span class="linenum">790</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youthful lover: there, a rich bequest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since Delphi now, if we may credit fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives no responses, and a long dark night     <span class="linenum">800</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">To go, or stay; but will not share his fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withheld by trines and sextiles; she will look,     <span class="linenum">830</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her chair be ordered, in the book,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rich consult a Babylonian seer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilled in the mysteries of either sphere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a gray-headed priest, hired by the state,     <span class="linenum">840</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the lightning, and to expiate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The middle sort, a quack, at whose command<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And left by some pond side, to perish there.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hence your Flamens, hence your Salians come;     <span class="linenum">870</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Scauri, chiefs and magistrates of Rome!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune stands tittering by, in playful mood,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, to the mansions of the great she bears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The precious brats, and, for herself, prepares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A secret farce; adopts them for her own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when her nurslings are to manhood grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She brings them forth, rejoiced to see them sped,     <span class="linenum">880</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Blows, insults, all a saucy wife can dare.     <span class="linenum">885</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence that swift lapse to second childhood; hence<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To this accursed draught; that only sent<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
<span class="i0">One palsied, bedrid sot, with gummy eyes,     <span class="linenum">900</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slavering lips, heels foremost to the skies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, to wild fury roused a bloody mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In one promiscuous slaughter high and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leveled half the nation at a blow.     <span class="linenum">905</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the power of philters! such the ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sorceress can effect by wicked skill!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They hate their husband's spurious issue:&mdash;this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this were all, were not, perhaps, amiss:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And be the first to look, the last to eat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But this is fiction all! I pass the bound     <span class="linenum">920</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Satire, and encroach on Tragic ground!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserting truth, I choose a fabled theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like the buskined bards of Greece, declaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deep-mouthed tones, in swelling strains, on crimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yet unknown to our Rutulian climes!     <span class="linenum">925</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would it were so! but Pontia cries aloud,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Crimes of dire name, which, disbelieved of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become familiar, and revolt no more;     <span class="linenum">935</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those ancient dames in scenes of blood were bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrought fell deeds, but not, as ours, for gold:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every age, we view, with less surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such horrors as from bursts of fury rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When stormy passions, scorning all control,     <span class="linenum">940</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rend the mad bosom, and unseat the soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when impetuous winds, and driving rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine some huge rock that overhangs the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cumbrous mass descends with thundering force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spreads resistless ruin in its course.     <span class="linenum">945</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Curse on the woman, who reflects by fits,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They see, upon the stage, the Grecian wife<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet, in her place, would willingly deprive     <span class="linenum">950</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lords of breath to keep their dogs alive!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Abroad, at home, the Belides you meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Clytemnestras swarm in every street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here the difference lies:&mdash;those bungling wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a blunt axe hacked out their husbands' lives;     <span class="linenum">955</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While now, the deed is done with dexterous art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a drugged bowl performs the axe's part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if the husband, prescient of his fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have fortified his breast with mithridate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She baffles him e'en there, and has recourse     <span class="linenum">960</span><br /></span>

JUVENAL, NÆVOLUS.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Juv. <span class="smcap">Still</span> drooping, Nævolus! What, prithee, say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Portends this show of grief from day to day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This copy of flayed Marsyas? what dost thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such a rueful face, and such a brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Ravola wore, when caught&mdash;Not so cast down     <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked Pollio, when, of late, he scoured the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, proffering treble rate, from friend to friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found none so foolish, none so mad, to lend!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, seriously, for thine's a serious case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence came those sudden wrinkles in thy face?     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew thee once, a gay, light-hearted slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contented with the little fortune gave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sprightly guest, of every table free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And famed for modish wit and repartee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now all's reversed: dejected is thy mien,     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy locks are like a tangled thicket seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every limb, once smoothed with nicest care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rank with neglect, a shrubbery of hair!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What dost thou with that dull, dead, withered look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some old debauchee, long ague-shook?     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is not well within; for, still we find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face the unerring index of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as <span class="smcap">THIS</span> feels or fancies joys or woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">That</span> pales with sorrow, or with rapture glows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should I think? Too sure the scene is changed,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou from thy old course of life estranged:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For late, as I remember, at all haunts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dames of fashion flock to hire gallants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Isis and at Ganymede's abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Cybele's, dread mother of the gods,     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, at chaste Ceres' (for at shame they spurn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even her temples now to brothels turn),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None was so famed: the favorites of the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baffled alike in business and renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring retired; wives, daughters, were thy own,     <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;if the truth <span class="smcap">MUST</span> come&mdash;not <span class="smcap">THEY</span> alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Næv.</span> Right: and to some this trade has answered yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not to me: for what is all I get?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A drugget cloak, to save my gown from rain,<span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coarse in its texture, dingy in its grain,<span class="bracket">}</span>     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Fate governs all.</span> Fate, with full sway, presides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even o'er those parts, which modest nature hides;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For your cursed pathics have such winning ways!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hear now this prodigy, this mass impure,     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lust and avarice! "Let us, friend, be sure:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The blooming youth, to whom we presents send,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sees adoring crowds besiege his gate!     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Insatiate sparrow! whom do your domains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your numerous hills await, your numerous plains?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regions, that such a tract of land embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kites are tired within the unmeasured space!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you the purple vine luxuriant glows,     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Trifoline's plain, and on Misenus' brows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hollow Gaurus, from his fruitful hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your spacious vaults with generous nectar fills:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were it, then, a few poor roods to grant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one so worn with lechery and want?     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure yonder female, with the child she bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog their playmate, and their little shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had, with more justice, been conferred on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than on a cymbal-beating debauchee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'm troublesome," you say, when I apply,     <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And give! give! give! is my eternal cry."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But house-rent due solicits to be sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my sole slave, importunate for bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows me, clamoring in as loud a tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Polyphemus, when his prey was flown.     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will this one suffice, the toil's so great!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another must be bought; and both must eat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall I say, when cold December blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their bare limbs shrink at the driving snows,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>

<span class="i2">But though my other merits you deny,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your wife had to this hour remained a maid.     <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Even when she'd canceled all her former vows,     <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now was signing to another spouse.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While you stood whimpering at the door all night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spare to tell:&mdash;a friend like me has tied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a knot, when ready to divide.     <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where will you turn you now, sir? whither fly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, to my charges, first, or last, reply?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whom you may breed with credit at your board,     <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">The traveler, freighted with a little wealth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Secure the while, he mocked at Fortune's frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she threatened, bade her hang or drown!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gave armies, empire, every thing, away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For two poor claims have long renounced the whole,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"But there are more to suffer." "So I find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fire so fierce for one was ne'er designed.     <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met my friend Brutidius, and I fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his pale looks, he thinks there's danger near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What if this Ajax, in his phrensy, strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicious of our zeal, at all alike!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"True: fly we then, our loyalty to show;     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lo! this most noble, this most beauteous youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hurried off, a helpless sacrifice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"But why all these?" You think, perhaps, the rite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were better, known to few, and kept from sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so the lady; she abhors a flaw,     <span class="linenum">495</span><br /></span>

<h3>SATIRE XI.<br />

TO PERSICUS.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If Atticus in sumptuous fare delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis taste: if Rutilus, 'tis madness quite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what diverts the sneering rabble more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than an Apicius miserably poor?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In every company, go where you will,     <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bath, forum, theatre, the talk is still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rutilus!&mdash;While fit (they cry) to wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With firm and vigorous arm, the spear and shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his full veins beat high with youthful blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced by no tribune&mdash;yet by none withstood,     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cultivates the gladiator's trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learns the imperious language of the blade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What swarms we see of this degenerate kind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swarms whom their creditors can only find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At flesh and fish-stalls:&mdash;thither they repair,     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure, though deceived at home, to catch them there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These live but for their palate; and, of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most distressed (while Ruin hastes to seize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crumbling mansion and disparting wall),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread richer feasts, and riot as they fall!&mdash;    <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, ere yet the last supply be spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They search for dainties every element,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awed by no price; nay, making this their boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still preferring that which costs them most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyous, and reckless of to-morrow's fate,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise a desperate sum, they pledge their plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mother's fractured image; to prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet one treat more, though but in earthen ware!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the fencer's mess they come, of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mount the scaffold as a last resource.     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">No foe to sumptuous boards, I only scan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When such are spread, the motives, and the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praise or censure, as I see the feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by the noble or the beggar dress'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this, 'tis gluttony; in that, fit pride,     <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sanctioned by wealth, by station dignified.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whip me the fool, who marks how Atlas soars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er every hill on Mauritania's shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sees no difference 'twixt the coffer's hoards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the poor pittance a small purse affords!     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven sent us "<span class="smcap">KNOW THYSELF!</span>"&mdash;Be this impress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In living characters, upon thy breast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or seek'st thou rather, in some doubtful cause,     <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vindicate thy country's injured laws?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knock at thy bosom, play the censor's part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And note with caution what and who thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An orator of force and skill profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a mere Matho, emptiness and sound!     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, <span class="smcap">KNOW THYSELF</span>: in great concerns, in small,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O think what end awaits thee, timely think,     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy throat widens as thy pockets shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy throat, of all thy father's thrift could save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flocks, herds, and fields, the insatiable grave!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, when naught remains a meal to bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last poor shift, off comes the knightly ring,     <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "sad Sir Pollio" begs his daily fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With undistinguished hands, and finger bare!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To these, an early grave no terror brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A short and merry life!" the spendthrift sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death seems to him a refuge from despair,     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far less terrible than hoary hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mark now the progress of their rapid fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Money (regardless of the monthly rate),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side, they borrow, and apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waste what is borrowed before the lender's face:     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, while they yet some wretched remnant hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pale usurer trembles for his gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wisely sicken for the country air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flock to Baiæ, Ostia, Jove knows where.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now 'tis held (so rife the evil's grown)     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No greater shame, for debt, to flee the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than from the thronged Suburra to remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dog-days, to the Esquilian shades above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thought alone, what time they leave behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends, country, all, weighs heavy on their mind,     <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thought alone&mdash;for twelve long months to lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dear delights of Rome, the public shows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sleeps the modest blood! In all our veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No conscious drop, to form a blush, remains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Shame</span>, from the town, derided, speeds her way,     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And few, alas! solicit her to stay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enough: to-day my Persicus shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether my precepts with my life agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether, with feigned austerity, I prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spare repast, a glutton in disguise!     <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bawl for coarse pottage, that my friends may hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whisper "sweetmeats!" in my servant's ear.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For since, by promise, you are now my guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, I invite you to no sumptuous feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to such simple fare, as long, long since,     <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good Evander bade the Trojan prince.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come then, my friend, you will not, sure, despise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The food that pleased the offspring of the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, and while fancy brings past times to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll think myself the king, the hero you.     <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take now your bill of fare: my simple board<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is with no dainties from the market stored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dishes all my own. From Tibur's stock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kid shall come, the fattest of the flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tenderest too, and yet too young to browse     <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thistle's shoots, the willow's watery boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more of milk than blood; and pullets dress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With new-laid eggs, yet tepid from the nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sperage wild, which, from the mountain's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My housemaid left her spindle to provide;     <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grapes long kept, yet pulpy still, and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rich Signian and the Syrian pear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And apples, that in flavor and in smell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boasted Picene equal, or excel:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor need you fear, my friend, their liberal use,     <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For age has mellowed and improved their juice.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How homely this! and yet this homely fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A senator would, once, have counted rare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the good Curius thought it no disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er a few sticks a little pot to place,     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With herbs by his small garden-plot supplied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Food, which the squalid wretch would now deride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who digs in fetters, and, with fond regret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tavern's savory dish remembers yet!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Time was, when, on the rack, a man would lay     <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seasoned flitch, against a solemn day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think the friends who met, with decent mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To celebrate the hour which gave him birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this, and what of fresh the altars spared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For altars then were honored), nobly fared.     <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some kinsman, who had camps and senates swayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had thrice been consul, once dictator made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From public cares retired, would gayly haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the wonted hour, to such repast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldering the spade, that, with no common toil,     <span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had tamed the genius of the mountain soil.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, when the world was filled with Rome's just fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Romans trembled at the Fabian name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Scauran, and Fabrician; when they saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A censor's rigor even a censor awe,     <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
<span class="i0">No son of Troy e'er thought it his concern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or worth a moment's serious care, to learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What land, what sea, the fairest tortoise bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose clouded shell might best adorn his bed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bed was small, and did no signs impart     <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or of the painter's or the sculptor's art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where the front, cheaply inlaid with brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed the rude features of a vine-crowned ass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An uncouth brute, round which his children played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed and jested at the face it made!     <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Briefly, his house, his furniture, his food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were uniformly plain, and simply good.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then the rough soldier, yet untaught by Greece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hang, enraptured, o'er a finished piece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If haply, 'mid the congregated spoils     <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Proofs of his power, and guerdon of his toils),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some antique vase of master-hands were found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would dash the glittering bauble on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, in new forms, the molten fragments dress'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might blaze illustrious round his courser's chest,     <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, flashing from his burnished helmet, show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A dreadful omen to the trembling foe)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty sire, with glittering shield and spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering, enamored, o'er the sleeping fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wolf, by Rome's high destinies made mild,     <span class="linenum">165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, playful at her side, each wondrous child.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, all the wealth those simple times could boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small wealth! their horses and their arms engross'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest was homely, and their frugal fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cooked without art, was served in earthen ware:     <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet worthy all our envy, were the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with one spark of noble spleen possess'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Then</span> shone the fanes with majesty divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A present god was felt at every shrine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And solemn sounds, heard from the sacred walls,     <span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At midnight's solemn hour, announced the Gauls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rushing from the main; while, prompt to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Jove, the prophet of the signs he gave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, when he thus revealed the will of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched attentive o'er the Latian state,     <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shrine, his statue, rose of humble mould,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of artless form, and unprofaned with gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those good old times no foreign tables sought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their own woods the walnut-tree was brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When withering limbs declared its pith unsound,     <span class="linenum">185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or winds uptore, and stretched it on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, such strange caprice has seized the great,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Suspect the flowers a sickly scent exhale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think the ven'son rank, the turbot stale,     <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless wide-yawning panthers, towering high&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enormous pedestals of ivory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Formed of the teeth which Elephantis sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the dark Moor, or darker Indian, vends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or those which, now, too heavy for the head,     <span class="linenum">195</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The spacious ORBS support: then they can feed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every dish is delicate indeed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For silver feet are viewed with equal scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As iron rings upon the finger worn.     <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">To me, forever be the guest unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, measuring my expenses by his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remarks the difference with a scornful leer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slights my humble house and homely cheer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look not to me for ivory; I have none:     <span class="linenum">205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My chess-board and my men are all of bone;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of learned Trypherus, to carve by rule;     <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where large sow-paps of elm, and boar, and hare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Clatter around, and deafen all the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My simple lad, whose highest efforts rise<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Knows no such art; humbly content to serve,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Another lad (for I have two to-day),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad, like the first, in homespun russet gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fill our earthen bowls: no Phrygian he,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But a rude rustic:&mdash;when you want him, speak,     <span class="linenum">225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak in Latin, for he knows not Greek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both go alike, with close-cropp'd hair, undress'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But spruced to-day in honor of my guest;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At the first mutterings of the hollow gale!     <span class="linenum">305</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sink with terror at the transient glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meteors, glancing through the turbid air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, 'tis not chance, they cry; this hideous crash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not the war of winds; nor this dread flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The encounter of dark clouds; but blasting fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charged with the wrath of heaven's insulted sire!     <span class="linenum">310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dreaded peal, innoxious, dies away;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet more; when the first symptoms of disease,     <span class="linenum">315</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And dare not tempt the mercy of the sky:     <span class="linenum">320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what can such expect! what victim slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is not worthier far to live than they!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With what a rapid change of fancy roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The varying passions of the guilty soul!&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere the mind labors with an innate sense<br /></span>

<h3>SATIRE XIV.<br />

TO FUSCINUS.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, there are faults, Fuscinus, that disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noblest qualities of birth and place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, like infectious blood, transmitted, run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one eternal stream, from sire to son.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If, in destructive play, the senior waste     <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His joyous nights, the child, with kindred taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeats, in miniature, the darling vice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes the small box, and cogs the little dice.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor does that infant fairer hopes inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, trained by the gray epicure, his sire,     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has learned to pickle mushrooms, and, like him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To souse the becaficos, till they swim!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For take him, thus to early luxury bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere twice four springs have blossomed o'er his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let ten thousand teachers, hoar with age,     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inculcate temperance from the stoic page;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wish will ever be, in state to dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep his kitchen's honor from decline!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Does Rutilus inspire a generous mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone to forgive, and to slight errors blind;     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instill the liberal thought, that slaves have powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sense, feeling, all, as exquisite as ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fury? He, who hears the sounding thong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With far more pleasure than the Siren's song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, the stern tyrant of his small domain,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Polypheme of his domestic train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows no delight, save when the torturer's hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stamps, for low theft, the agonizing brand.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, what but rage can fill that stripling's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sees his savage sire then only blest,     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his stretched ears drink in the wretches' cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And racks and prisons fill his vengeful eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dare we hope, yon girl, from Larga sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will e'er prove virtuous; when her little tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er told so fast her mother's wanton train,     <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that she stopped and breathed, and stopped again?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from her tender years, unnatural trust!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child was privy to the matron's lust:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce ripe for man, with her own hand, she writes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The billets, which the ancient bawd indites,     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Employs the self-same pimps, and looks, ere long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share the visits of the amorous throng!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So Nature prompts: drawn by her secret tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We view a parent's deeds with reverent eye;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With fatal haste, alas! the example take,     <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love the sin, for the dear sinner's sake.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One youth, perhaps, formed of superior clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warmed, by Titan, with a purer ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May dare to slight proximity of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in despite of nature, to be good:     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One youth&mdash;the rest the beaten pathway tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blindly follow where their fathers led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fatal guides! this reason should suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win you from the slippery route of vice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This powerful reason; lest your sons pursue     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilty track, thus plainly marked by you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For youth is facile, and its yielding will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receives, with fatal ease, the imprint of ill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence Catilines in every clime abound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where are Cato and his nephew found!     <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swift from the roof where youth, Fuscinus, dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immodest sights, immodest sounds expel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The place is sacred</span>: Far, far hence, remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye venal votaries of illicit love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye dangerous knaves, who pander to be fed,     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sell yourselves to infamy for bread!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Reverence to children, as to heaven, is due</span>:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you would, then, some darling sin pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think that your infant offspring eyes the deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the thought abate your guilty speed,     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back from the headlong steep your steps entice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And check you, tottering on the verge of vice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O yet reflect! for should he e'er provoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In riper age, the law's avenging stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Since not alone in person and in face,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even in morals, he will prove his race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while example acts with fatal force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Side, nay outstrip, you, in the vicious course),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vexed, you will rave and storm; perhaps, prepare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&mdash;Audacious! with what front do you aspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To exercise the license of a sire?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The youth, in turpitude, surpassed by you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By you, old fool, whose windy, brainless head,     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since required the cupping-glass's aid!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is there a guest expected? all is haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hurry in the house, from first to last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sweep the dry cobwebs down!" the master cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whips in his hand, and fury in his eyes,     <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">O inconsistent wretch! is all this coil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the front hall, or gallery, daubed with soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Which, yet, a little sand removes), offend     <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prying eye of some indifferent friend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do you stir not, that your son may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house from moral filth, from vices free!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">True, you have given a citizen to Rome;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she shall thank you, if the youth become,     <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By your o'er-ruling care, or soon or late,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His country's glory, or his country's shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stork, with snakes and lizards from the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pathless wild, supports her callow brood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fledged storklings, when to wing they take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek the same reptiles, through the devious brake.     <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vulture snuffs from far the tainted gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hurrying where the putrid scents exhale,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And to her young the loathsome dainty bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her young, grown vigorous, hasten from the nest,     <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gorge on carrion, with the parent's zest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scours the wide champaign for untainted food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears the swift hare, or swifter fawn away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey;     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her nestlings hence, when from the rock they spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, pinched by hunger, to the quarry wing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When, clamorous, from the shell, to light they burst.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Centronius planned and built, and built and planned;     <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now along Cajeta's winding strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now amid Præneste's hills, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On lofty Tibur's solitary brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reared prodigious piles, with marble brought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While thus Centronius crowded seat on seat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which his mad son, to the last farthing, spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, building on, he strove, with fond desire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This first: the prepuce next he lays aside,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And capering to a sooty minstrel's pipe.     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coarse unguents, chaplets, flowers, on this side fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that, keen hatred, and deliberate spite!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At first both sides, though eager to engage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With taunts and jeers, the heralds of their rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow up their mutual fury; and anon,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindled to madness, with loud shouts rush on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deal, though unarmed, their vengeance blindly round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with clenched fists print many a ghastly wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then might you see, amid the desperate fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Features disfigured, noses torn away,     <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands, where the gore of mangled eyes yet reeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jaw-bones starting through the cloven cheeks!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But this is sport, mere children's play, they cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yet beneath their feet no bodies lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to what purpose should such armies fight     <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause of heaven, if none be slain outright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roused at the thought, more fiercely they engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stones, the weapons of intestine rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not precisely such, to tell you true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Turnus erst, or mightier Ajax, threw:     <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor quite so large as that two-handed stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which bruised Æneas on the huckle-bone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such as men, in our degenerate days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, how unlike to theirs! make shift to raise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in his time, Mæonides could trace     <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some diminution of the human race:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, earth, grown old and frigid, rears with pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pigmy brood, a weak and wicked train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which every god, who marks their passions vile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regards with laughter, though he loathes the while.     <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">But to our tale. Enforced with armed supplies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The zealous Tent'rites feel their courage rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wave their swords, and, kindling at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press on, and with fell rage renew the fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ombites flee; they follow:&mdash;in the rear,     <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A luckless wretch, confounded by his fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trips and falls headlong; with loud yelling cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pack rush in, and seize him as he lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now the conquerors, none to disappoint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the dire banquet, tear him joint by joint,     <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dole him round; the bones yet warm, they gnaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And champ the flesh that heaves beneath their jaw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They want no cook to dress it&mdash;'twould be long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And appetite is keen, and rage is strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, Volusius, I rejoice at least,     <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fire was unprofaned by this cursed feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, rapt from heaven! and you will, sure, agree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet the element's escape, with me.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;But all who ventured on the carcass, swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They never tasted&mdash;aught so sweet before!     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the relish charm the first alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who arrived too late for flesh, or bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stooped down, and scraping where the wretch had lain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With savage pleasure licked the gory plain!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Vascons once (the story yet is rife),     <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such dire sustenance prolonged their life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then the cause was different: Fortune, there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proved adverse: they had borne the extremes of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rage of famine, the still-watchful foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the ills beleaguered cities know.     <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And nothing else should prompt mankind to use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such desperate means.) May this their crime excuse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after every root and herb were gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every aliment to hunger known;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When their lean frames, and cheeks of sallow hue,     <span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck even the foe with pity at the view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all were ready their own flesh to tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They first adventured on this horrid fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surely every god would pity grant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To men so worn by wretchedness and want,     <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even the very ghosts of those they ate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absolve them, mindful of their dreadful state!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">True, we are wiser; and, by Zeno taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know life itself may be too dearly bought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the poor Vascon, in that early age,     <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew naught of Zeno, or the Stoic page.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, thanks to Greece and Rome, in wisdom's robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bearded tribes rush forth, and seize the globe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already, learned Gaul aspires to teach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your British orators the Art of Speech,     <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thulé, blessings on her, seems to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'll hire a good grammarian, cost what may.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Vascons, then, who thus prolonged their breath,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Brave too, like them, but by worse ills subdued,     <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The barbarous rites we disbelieved of yore)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reared her dread altar near the Tauric flood,<br /></span>

TO GALLUS.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who can recount the advantages that wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear Gallus, on the Military State?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For let me once, beneath a lucky star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint as I am of heart, and new to war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But join the camp, and that ascendant hour     <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall lord it o'er my fate with happier power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than if a line from Venus should commend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My suit to Mars, or Juno stand my friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And first, of benefits which all may share:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis somewhat&mdash;that no citizen shall dare     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike you, or, though struck, return the blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But waive the wrong; nor to the Prætor show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His teeth dashed out, his face deformed with gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes no skill can promise to restore!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A Judge, if to the camp your plaints you bear,     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coarse shod, and coarser greaved, awaits you there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By antique law proceeds the cassocked sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rules prescribed in old Camillus' age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>To wit</em>, <span class="old-english">Let soldiers seek no foreign bench,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="old-english">Nor plead to any charge without the trench</span>.     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O nicely do Centurions sift the cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When buff-and-belt-men violate the laws!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ample, if with reason we complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, doubtless, the redress our injuries gain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so:&mdash;but the whole legion are our foes,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with determined aim, the award oppose.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"These sniveling rogues take special pleasure still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the punishment outweigh the ill."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So runs the cry; and he must be possest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of more, Vagellius, than thy iron breast,     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who braves their anger, and, with ten poor toes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defies such countless hosts of hobnailed shoes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who so untutored in the ways of Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, who so true a Pylades, to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the camp?&mdash;no; let thy tears be dried,     <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ask that kindness, which must be denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, when the Court exclaims, "Your witness, here!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let that firm friend, that man of men, appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And testify but what he saw and heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I pronounce him worthy of the beard     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">False witnesses against an honest hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easier than true (and who their fears can blame?),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against a soldier's purse, a soldier's fame!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But there are other benefits, my friend,     <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greater, which the sons of war attend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should a litigious neighbor bid me yield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My vale irriguous, and paternal field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from my bounds the sacred landmark tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which, with each revolving spring, I bear,     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pious duty to the grateful soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My humble offerings, honey, meal, and oil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a vile debtor my just claims withstand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deny his signet, and abjure his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Term after Term I wait, till months be past,     <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce obtain a hearing at the last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even when the hour is fixed, a thousand stays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retard my suit, a thousand vague delays:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause is called, the witnesses attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chairs brought, and cushions laid&mdash;and there an end:     <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cæditius finds his cloak or gown too hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fuscus slips aside to seek the pot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, with our dearest hopes the judges sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we rise to speak, dismiss the Court!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But spear-and-shield-men may command the hour;     <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time to plead is always in their power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor are their wealth and patience worn away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the slow drag-chain of the law's delay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Add that the soldier, while his father lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he alone, his wealth bequeaths or gives;     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what by pay is earned, by plunder won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The law declares, vests solely in the son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coranus therefore sees his hoary sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain his Will, by every art, aspire!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose by service; rank in fields obtained,     <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well deserved the fortune which he gained.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And every prudent chief must, sure, desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That still the worthiest should the most acquire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That those who merit, their rewards should have,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unless you drew the gods aside, to name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While other great ones stand, with down-cast eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a silent censer tempt the skies!&mdash;    <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hard, hard the task, from the low, muttered prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To free the fanes; or find one suppliant there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Once, twice, and thrice in Tiber's eddying wave<br /></span>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
